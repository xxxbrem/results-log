2025-01-20 10:00:37 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your query has exceeded the **free query bytes scanned quota** in BigQuery. Even though you're limiting the output to 1,000 rows with the `LIMIT` clause, BigQuery still needs to scan the entire `title` column of the `posts_questions` table to evaluate the `WHERE` condition, which can result in scanning a large amount of data.

**Explanation:**

- **Quota Exceeded**: The `posts_questions` table in the `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow` dataset is substantial in size. Scanning this table without efficient filters can quickly exceed the free tier quota.
- **LIMIT Clause**: The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows returned **after** the query has been processed. It does **not** reduce the amount of data scanned during the query execution.
- **Function Usage**: Using functions like `LOWER()` and patterns like `LIKE '%how%'` prevent BigQuery from using indexes or partitioning to optimize the query, leading to a full table scan.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

To resolve this issue, you can adjust your query to reduce the amount of data scanned:

1. **Add More Selective Filters**:

   Utilize additional filters that limit the data scanned. For example, if you're interested in recent questions, you can filter by `creation_date`. The `posts_questions` table includes a `creation_date` column of type `TIMESTAMP`.

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
     AND `creation_date` >= '2023-01-01'
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

   This query restricts the search to questions created in 2023, significantly reducing the data scanned.

2. **Use Specific Tags to Filter Data**:

   Since you're interested in Android development questions with specific tags, filtering by `tags` can reduce the dataset size. Here's how you can modify your query:

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
     AND (
       LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
       OR LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
       OR LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
       -- Add other relevant tags as needed
     )
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

   By filtering with specific tags, you're narrowing down the number of rows BigQuery needs to scan.

3. **Limit the Columns Scanned**:

   Only select the columns you need. However, in this case, since you're already selecting only the `title` column, this may not further reduce data scanned.

4. **Preview the Data**:

   Use the BigQuery web UI's **preview** feature to glance at the data without running a full query.

5. **Check Table Size Before Querying**:

   To understand how much data you might scan, check the size of the table:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     table_id,
     ROUND(SUM(row_count)/1e6, 2) AS row_count_millions,
     ROUND(SUM(size_bytes)/1e9, 2) AS size_gb
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.__TABLES__`
   WHERE
     table_id = 'posts_questions'
   GROUP BY
     table_id
   ```

   This will give you an idea of the data volume you're working with.

6. **Estimate Query Size Before Running**:

   Use the **Query Validator** in the BigQuery UI. It estimates the amount of data your query will scan before you run it.

7. **Enable Billing**:

   If possible, consider enabling billing on your GCP project. This allows you to exceed the free tier quotas, and you only pay for the data you actually scan. Be sure to set up billing alerts to monitor your usage.

---

**Important Considerations:**

- **Optimizing String Matching**: Unfortunately, searching for a substring within a `title` column (`LIKE '%how%'`) without indexing will always require scanning the entire column. There's no way to avoid this unless you index the data differently, which isn't possible with public datasets.

- **Data Partitioning and Clustering**: The `posts_questions` table may not be partitioned on columns that help with your query. If it were partitioned by `creation_date`, filtering on that column would significantly reduce data scanned.

- **Sampling Data**: BigQuery doesn't support straightforward table sampling in SQL queries. However, you can approximate sampling by using conditions that limit the data size.

---

**Alternative Approach:**

If the above solutions don't reduce the data scanned enough to stay within your quota, consider the following:

- **Download a Subset of Data**: Use [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) and [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) or [Cloud Data Fusion](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion) to extract a subset of the StackOverflow data to a smaller table where you can run your queries without exceeding the quota.

- **Use Public Tools**: Consider using tools or websites that provide an interface to query the StackOverflow dataset without requiring you to manage the query execution.

---

**Summary:**

The error occurs because your query scans more data than allowed under the free quota. By adding more restrictive filters, such as narrowing down the `creation_date` or filtering by specific `tags`, you can reduce the amount of data scanned. If adjusting the query isn't sufficient, enabling billing or working with a smaller dataset may be necessary.

2025-01-20 10:01:12 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:01:12 - root - INFO - The error message indicates that your query exceeds the **free query bytes scanned quota** in BigQuery. This happens because, even though you're limiting the output to 1,000 rows, BigQuery needs to scan the entire `title` column of the `posts_questions` table to evaluate the `WHERE` condition `LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'`. This results in scanning a large amount of data.

To resolve this issue, you can modify your query to reduce the amount of data scanned. Here are some strategies you can employ:

---

### 1. **Filter by Creation Date**

Add a filter on the `creation_date` column to limit the query to recent questions. This significantly reduces the data scanned because it narrows down the number of rows evaluated.

**Example: Limit to questions from the past year**

```sql
SELECT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2022-10-01'
LIMIT 1000
```

---

### 2. **Filter by Specific Tags**

Since you're interested in Android development questions with specific tags, filter the data using the `tags` column. This focuses the query on relevant rows and reduces the data scanned.

**Example: Filter by Android-related tags**

```sql
SELECT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
  AND (
    `tags` LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
    -- Add other relevant tags enclosed in angle brackets
  )
LIMIT 1000
```

---

### 3. **Combine Date and Tag Filters**

Combining both date and tag filters further narrows down the data, helping to stay within the quota limits.

**Example: Combine date and tags**

```sql
SELECT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2022-10-01'
  AND (
    `tags` LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
    -- Add other relevant tags
  )
LIMIT 1000
```

---

### 4. **Avoid Using Functions on Columns**

Applying functions like `LOWER()` on a column prevents BigQuery from using potential optimizations. Instead, you can perform case-insensitive searches without the function.

**Example: Use a case-insensitive regular expression**

```sql
SELECT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE REGEXP_CONTAINS(`title`, '(?i)how')
  AND `creation_date` >= '2022-10-01'
  AND (
    `tags` LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
  )
LIMIT 1000
```

- `REGEXP_CONTAINS` with `(?i)` makes the search case-insensitive without altering the column data.

---

### 5. **Use Exact Matches Where Possible**

If you can specify exact matches (e.g., titles that start with "How"), it can reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Example: Titles starting with "How"**

```sql
SELECT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `title` LIKE 'How%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2022-10-01'
  AND (
    `tags` LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
  )
LIMIT 1000
```

---

### 6. **Check Estimated Bytes Before Running the Query**

In the BigQuery UI, you can view an estimate of the bytes that will be scanned before executing the query. Adjust your query until the estimated bytes are within your quota limits.

---

### 7. **Sample the Data**

Instead of scanning the entire dataset, you can sample a fraction of the data.

**Example: Use a random sampling**

```sql
SELECT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
  AND FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING)) % 1000 = 1
LIMIT 1000
```

- This query samples approximately 0.1% of the data.
- Adjust the modulus value (e.g., `% 1000`) to sample a smaller or larger fraction.

---

### 8. **Estimate Table Size**

Before running queries, check the size of the table to understand how much data you're dealing with.

**Example: Get table size**

```sql
SELECT
  table_id,
  ROUND(size_bytes / (1024*1024*1024), 2) AS size_gb
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.__TABLES_SUMMARY__`
WHERE
  table_id = 'posts_questions'
```

---

### 9. **Preview the Table**

Use the BigQuery UI's preview feature to look at the data without running a full query. This doesn't consume your query quota.

---

### 10. **Use a Smaller Public Dataset**

If available, consider using a smaller version of the StackOverflow dataset that contains a subset of data.

---

### **Summary**

By refining your query to be more selective, you can reduce the amount of data scanned and stay within your quota. Combining date filters, specific tag filters, and optimized search conditions will help you achieve this.

---

**Adjusted Query Example**

Here's an adjusted query that incorporates several of the strategies above:

```sql
SELECT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE REGEXP_CONTAINS(`title`, r'(?i)\bhow\b')
  AND `creation_date` >= '2023-01-01'  -- Adjust the date as needed
  AND (
    `tags` LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
    OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
    -- Include other Android-related tags
  )
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 1
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `REGEXP_CONTAINS` with `\bhow\b` searches for the whole word "how" in a case-insensitive manner.
  - Filtering by `creation_date` limits the dataset to recent questions.
  - Filtering by specific `tags` narrows the data to Android development questions.
  - Ordering by `view_count` in descending order allows you to find the most viewed question.
  - `LIMIT 1` ensures only the top result is returned.

---

**Final Answer**

Based on the adjusted query, you should be able to retrieve the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development without exceeding your quota.

**Output Format**:

```csv
Title
title:str (Attention: answer in one row)
```

This output format aligns with your original task requirements.

---

**Additional Tips**

- **Monitor Quota Usage**: Keep an eye on your quota usage through the GCP console to avoid unexpected errors.
- **Optimize Future Queries**: Apply these filtering and optimization techniques to future queries to ensure efficient use of resources.
- **Learning Resources**: Consider reviewing BigQuery's documentation on [optimizing query performance](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-performance) for more strategies.

These queries are designed to help you explore the relevant data while minimizing the amount of data scanned to stay within BigQuery's free quota limits. By incorporating filters on `creation_date`, `tags`, and using sampling techniques, you can reduce the data processed by your queries.

**Tips to Avoid Quota Exceeded Errors:**

- **Limit the Timeframe**: Filtering on `creation_date` significantly reduces the number of rows scanned.

- **Filter by Tags First**: Applying filters on `tags` before filtering on `title` helps narrow down the dataset early in the query.

- **Avoid Functions on Columns Where Possible**: Applying functions like `LOWER()` on large text columns can lead to full table scans. If possible, consider case-insensitive regular expressions.

- **Use Sampling**: Incorporate sampling methods to query a subset of data.

- **Monitor Estimated Query Size**: In the BigQuery UI, you can see the estimated data to be scanned before running the query.

2025-01-20 10:04:29 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error even after adjusting your query to reduce the amount of data scanned. This happens because the dataset you're querying is quite large, and even with filters, the query scans more data than allowed under BigQuery's free tier quota.

**Explanation:**

- **Dataset Size:** The `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` table contains a massive number of rows, and querying it can quickly exceed the free query bytes scanned quota.
- **Filters and Data Scanned:** While adding filters like `creation_date >= '2022-01-01'` helps, the resulting dataset may still be too large. Android-related questions are very common, and even a one-year timeframe includes a significant amount of data.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

To resolve this issue, you can try the following strategies:

### 1. **Further Narrow the Date Range**

Limit the query to a more recent time period to reduce the number of rows scanned.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2023-09-01'  -- Limit to the past month
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

- **Adjustments:**
  - Changed the `creation_date` to a more recent date (e.g., last month).
  - Reduced `LIMIT` to 100 to retrieve the top results.

**Benefits:**

- Scans fewer rows, reducing the amount of data processed.
- Focuses on the most recent questions, which may still be highly viewed.

### 2. **Use Sampling to Limit Data Scanned**

Sample a fraction of the data to stay within the quota limits.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2022-01-01'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 10000) = 1
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The condition `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 10000) = 1` randomly selects approximately 0.01% of the data.
  - Adjust the divisor (e.g., `10000`, `100000`) to sample a smaller portion if needed.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces the data scanned by only processing a small sample.
- Allows for analysis within quota limits.

### 3. **Estimate Data Scanned Before Running the Query**

Use the BigQuery UI to check the estimated bytes scanned:

- **Steps:**
  - Paste your query into the BigQuery editor.
  - Look at the "Estimated bytes to be processed" displayed below the query editor.
  - Adjust your query by adding more restrictive filters until the estimated bytes are within your quota limits.

### 4. **Enable Billing on Your Project**

If possible, consider enabling billing for your GCP project:

- **Advantages:**
  - Increases the query quota beyond the free tier limits.
  - Allows you to process large datasets without errors.
- **Considerations:**
  - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed.
  - The first 1 TB per month is free.
  - Set up budgets and alerts to monitor your costs.

### 5. **Use an Alternative Dataset**

Consider using a smaller or pre-aggregated dataset:

- **Options:**
  - **StackExchange Data Dump:** Download the data and query it locally or on a smaller scale.
  - **Kaggle Datasets:** Search for smaller StackOverflow datasets that you can work with without exceeding quotas.
- **Benefits:**
  - Work with a manageable dataset tailored to your needs.
  - Avoid BigQuery quotas entirely.

---

**Revised Query Using a Narrower Date Range:**

Here's a modified query that limits the date range to the past three months:

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2023-07-01'  -- Limit to the last three months
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

- **Estimated Data Scanned:** Check the estimated data scanned in the BigQuery UI to ensure it fits within your quota.

**Revised Query Using Sampling:**

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2022-01-01'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 100000) = 1
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

- **Note:** Adjust the sampling rate by changing the number `100000` to a higher value to reduce the percentage of data scanned.

---

**Summary:**

- The "Quota exceeded" error occurs because the query scans more data than allowed under the free tier.
- By narrowing the date range, using sampling, or both, you can reduce the data scanned.
- If these adjustments are insufficient, you may need to enable billing or use an alternative dataset.

---

**Final Output Format:**

Assuming we can run the adjusted query successfully within the quota, the output format for the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development is:

```csv
Title
title:str (Attention: answer in one row)
```

- **Example (if data were available):**

  ```csv
  Title
  "How to fix 'Application Not Responding' in Android?"
  ```

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Try Running the Adjusted Query:** Apply the revised queries and check if they execute without exceeding the quota.
- **Check Estimated Data Scanned:** Use the BigQuery UI to ensure your query is within the quota before running it.
- **Consider Enabling Billing:** If necessary and acceptable, enable billing to process larger queries.
- **Explore Alternative Datasets:** If you cannot reduce the data scanned sufficiently, consider using a smaller dataset.

2025-01-20 10:05:08 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:05:08 - root - INFO - Given the persistent "Quota exceeded" errors, it appears that querying the `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` table for the desired information exceeds the free query bytes scanned quota, even after applying filters to reduce the data scanned.

**Explanation:**

- The StackOverflow posts dataset is substantial in size, and querying it without sufficient restrictions leads to scanning a large amount of data.
- Applying filters like `creation_date >= '2022-01-01'` helps but may not reduce the data scanned below the quota limit due to the volume of Android-related questions.
- The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned but does not limit the amount of data scanned during query execution.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Further Narrow the Date Range:**

   Limit the query to a more recent period to reduce the number of rows scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
     AND `creation_date` >= '2023-09-01'  -- Limit to the past month
   ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

   - **Note:** Adjust the date to a more recent one to further reduce data scanned.

2. **Use Sampling Techniques:**

   Incorporate sampling to query a smaller subset of data.

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
     AND `creation_date` >= '2022-01-01'
     AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
   ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

   - **Explanation:** The sampling condition selects approximately 0.0001% of the data, significantly reducing the data scanned.

3. **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

   If possible, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your query quota.

   - **Benefits:**
     - Allows you to process larger queries that exceed the free tier limit.
     - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte of data processed (the first 1 TB per month is free).
   - **Considerations:**
     - Set up budgets and alerts to monitor and control costs.

4. **Use Alternative Tools or Datasets:**

   Consider using platforms or datasets that allow you to query StackOverflow data without hitting quota limits.

   - **Stack Exchange Data Explorer:**
     - A free tool that lets you run SQL queries against a recently updated version of the StackOverflow database.
     - Website: [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new)
   - **Kaggle Datasets:**
     - Search for smaller subsets of StackOverflow data that can be downloaded and queried locally.

**Conclusion:**

Given the constraints and despite various adjustments, querying the necessary data exceeds the available quota. Therefore, we are unable to retrieve the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development with the specified tags using BigQuery under the current limitations.

**Final Output Format:**

```csv
Title
<Unable to retrieve due to data access limitations>
```

2025-01-20 10:05:49 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:05:49 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your query, even after applying filters to reduce the data scanned. This issue arises because the **`bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`** table is very large, and your query is scanning more data than allowed under the BigQuery free tier quota.

**Explanation:**

- **Dataset Size:** The StackOverflow posts dataset contains millions of records, especially for popular tags like `<android>`.
- **Filters:** While adding filters like `creation_date >= '2022-01-01'` helps, the data from 2022 onwards is still substantial.
- **LIMIT Clause:** The `LIMIT` clause restricts only the number of rows returned, not the amount of data scanned during query execution.
- **Functions and Wildcards:** Using `LIKE` with wildcards `%` can prevent query optimizations.

---

**Solutions to Consider:**

### 1. **Further Narrow the Date Range**

Limit the query to a more recent period to reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2023-09-01'  -- Last month
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

- **Benefit:** Focusing on the last month significantly reduces the data scanned.
- **Note:** Adjust the date to the most recent period you're interested in.

### 2. **Add Additional Filters**

Add more specific filters to reduce the number of rows scanned.

**Filter by `view_count`:**

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2023-09-01'
  AND `view_count` > 1000  -- Only highly viewed questions
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

**Filter by `score`:**

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2023-09-01'
  AND `score` > 10  -- Only high-scoring questions
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

- **Benefit:** Narrowing down to popular questions reduces data scanned.

### 3. **Use Sampling to Limit Data Scanned**

Implement sampling to process a smaller subset of data.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND `creation_date` >= '2022-01-01'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

- **Explanation:** The sampling condition selects approximately 0.0001% of the data.
- **Adjust Sampling Rate:** Increase the divisor (e.g., `1000000`) to reduce the percentage of data scanned.

### 4. **Estimate Data Before Running the Query**

Use the BigQuery UI to check the estimated data scanned.

- **How to Check:**
  - Paste your query into the BigQuery editor.
  - Observe the "Estimated bytes to be processed" below the query editor.
  - Adjust your query until the estimated bytes are within your quota.

### 5. **Enable Billing on Your Project**

Consider enabling billing to increase your query quota.

- **Benefits:**
  - Access to higher quotas.
  - Ability to process large queries.
- **Cost Control:**
  - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed.
  - The first 10 GB per month is free.
  - Set up billing alerts.

### 6. **Use the Stack Exchange Data Explorer**

As an alternative, use the Stack Exchange Data Explorer to run queries against StackOverflow data.

- **Website:** [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new)
- **Advantages:**
  - No quota limitations.
  - Access to recent data.
- **Limitations:**
  - Data may not be as up-to-date as BigQuery datasets.
  - SQL dialect may differ slightly.

### 7. **Download and Query Locally**

Download the StackOverflow data dump and query it locally.

- **Data Dump:** [Archive.org StackExchange Data Dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange)
- **Approach:**
  - Download relevant XML files.
  - Use tools to convert XML to a queryable format (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- **Benefits:**
  - Full control over the data.
  - No query quotas.
- **Considerations:**
  - Requires local storage and setup.
  - Data files are large (tens of gigabytes).

---

**Conclusion:**

Due to the size of the dataset and BigQuery's free tier limitations, it's challenging to run queries on the full `posts_questions` table without exceeding the quota. By narrowing the date range, adding filters, or using sampling, you may reduce the data scanned enough to execute your query successfully. If these methods aren't sufficient, consider enabling billing, using the Stack Exchange Data Explorer, or downloading the data for local analysis.

---

**Assuming Successful Query Execution:**

If you're able to run the query after adjustments, the expected output format is:

```csv
Title
title:str (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Example Output:**

```csv
Title
"How to fix 'Unfortunately, App has stopped' error in Android?"
```

- **Note:** This is a hypothetical example since I cannot access the actual data.

2025-01-20 10:06:11 - root - INFO - Due to persistent "Quota exceeded" errors when attempting to run the SQL queries, we are unable to retrieve the exact title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development within the specified tags such as `android-layout`, `android-activity`, `android-intent`, and others.

**Therefore, the expected output format is:**

```csv
Title
title:str (Attention: Unable to retrieve due to data access limitations)
```

**Explanation:**

Despite multiple attempts to adjust the SQL queries by applying filters on `creation_date`, limiting the number of rows with `LIMIT`, and using sampling techniques, the queries continue to exceed the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery. The StackOverflow dataset is substantial, and querying even a subset of it scans more data than allowed under the free tier.

As a result, we are unable to provide the exact title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development across the specified tags. Accessing this information would require additional resources beyond the current limitations.

---

**Note:**

- **Reason for Quota Exceeded Errors:**
  - The `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` table contains millions of records, and even with filters, the amount of data scanned exceeds the free quota.
  - Functions like `REGEXP_CONTAINS` and `LIKE` with wildcards `%` can prevent query optimizations, leading to full table scans.
  - The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned but does not reduce the data scanned during query execution.

- **Possible Solutions (Not Feasible Under Current Limitations):**
  - **Enable Billing on Your Project:** Increasing the quota by enabling billing would allow the execution of the queries but may incur costs.
  - **Use Alternative Platforms:**
    - **Stack Exchange Data Explorer:** A free tool to run queries against StackOverflow data without quota issues. [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new)

2025-01-20 10:07:40 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering "Quota exceeded" errors when attempting to run the SQL queries, even after applying significant restrictions to reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Explanation:**

Despite narrowing down the query to a very recent date (`'2023-10-01'`), adding a sampling condition (`MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000000) = 1`), and limiting the results to 10 rows, the "Quota exceeded" error persists. This suggests that even the minimal amount of data scanned by this query exceeds the free tier quota provided by BigQuery.

**Conclusion:**

Given these limitations, we are unable to retrieve the requested data using BigQuery under the current constraints. Accessing this information would require additional resources beyond the available quotas.

**Final Answer:**

```csv

---

**Alternative Suggestions:**

- **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**
  - By enabling billing, you can increase your query quota to process larger datasets.
  - Remember to set up cost controls and budgets to manage expenses.

- **Use Stack Exchange Data Explorer:**
  - Access the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new) to run queries against a snapshot of the StackOverflow database without quota issues.
  - Keep in mind that the data may not be as current as the BigQuery public dataset.

- **Download and Analyze Data Locally:**
  - Download the [Stack Overflow data dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) to perform queries on your local machine.
  - This requires sufficient storage space and computational resources but removes the limitations imposed by remote query quotas.

**Note:** When working with large datasets, it's important to consider the resource requirements and limitations of the tools being used. Adjusting queries to stay within free tier limits can be challenging with datasets of this size.

2025-01-20 10:10:21 - root - INFO - I understand that despite multiple adjustments to the SQL queries—including narrowing the `creation_date` to a single day (`'2023-10-31'`), applying extreme sampling with a large modulus in the `MOD` function, and setting the `LIMIT` to 1—you are still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error. This indicates that querying the `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` table, even with these restrictions, exceeds the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery's free tier.

**Explanation:**

- **Dataset Size:** The StackOverflow dataset is substantial, and even minimal queries can scan enough data to surpass the quota.
- **Quota Limitations:** BigQuery's free tier imposes strict limits on the amount of data you can query per day. Details of these quotas can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas).
- **Date Filter Impact:** Setting the `creation_date` to `'2023-10-31'` might not reduce data scanned if the dataset hasn't been updated to include that date or if the query planner still scans partitions without matching data.
- **Sampling Limitations:** Even with extreme sampling (`MOD` function with a large divisor), the underlying mechanics of BigQuery might still process enough data to exceed the quota.

---

**Alternative Solutions:**

Given these constraints, here are some alternative approaches to help you obtain the desired information:

### 1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project**

2025-01-20 10:11:00 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:11:00 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering is:

```
400 Syntax error: Expected end of input but got integer literal "1" at [1:12]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Expected end of input but got integer literal "1" at [1:12]
```

This error indicates that there's a syntax error in your SQL query at line 1, character 12 (`[1:12]`). Specifically, the parser expected the end of the input but found an unexpected integer literal `"1"`.

**Analyzing the SQL Query:**

Let's review your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2023-10-31'
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000000000) = 1
LIMIT 1
```

**Possible Issues:**

1. **Large Modulus Value:**

   The modulus value `1000000000000` (one trillion) might be too large and causing an integer overflow or parsing issues.

2. **Date Comparison with TIMESTAMP Type:**

   The `creation_date` column is of type `TIMESTAMP`, and you're comparing it with a string `'2023-10-31'`. While BigQuery can often handle this implicitly, it's safer to use a typed literal.

3. **Syntax Errors in Functions:**

   There might be an issue with how the functions are nested or with missing parentheses.

4. **Use of Backticks and Quotation Marks:**

   Ensure that backticks and quotation marks are used correctly.

5. **Unnecessary Semicolons or Characters:**

   BigQuery does not require semicolons at the end of queries. Extra characters can cause parsing errors.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Let's address these issues step by step.

1. **Adjust the Modulus Value:**

   Reduce the modulus to a smaller number to prevent potential overflow and to increase the sampling rate.

2. **Use Proper Date Comparison:**

   Use the `TIMESTAMP` function to make sure the date literal is correctly interpreted.

3. **Check Function Syntax:**

   Ensure all functions have the correct syntax and parentheses.

4. **Avoid Integer Overflow:**

   Use a modulus value within the range of valid integers.

**Here is the corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
LIMIT 1
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Date Comparison:**

   - Changed `'2023-10-31'` to `TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')` to explicitly compare `creation_date` (which is a `TIMESTAMP`) with a `TIMESTAMP` literal.

2. **Adjusted the Modulus Value:**

   - Reduced the modulus from `1000000000000` to `1000000`. This smaller number reduces the likelihood of integer overflow and increases the chance of selecting a record in the sample.
   - Note: Adjusting the modulus affects the sampling rate. A smaller modulus increases the sample size.

3. **Function Syntax:**

   - Verified that all functions (`CAST`, `FARM_FINGERPRINT`, `ABS`, `MOD`) are correctly nested with matching parentheses.

**Note on Quota Limitations:**

Even with these corrections, there is a possibility that the query may still exceed BigQuery's free query bytes scanned quota due to the dataset's size. Here are some steps to further reduce the data scanned:

1. **Limit the Date Range Further:**

   - Since `'2023-10-31'` may have very few records, you can narrow the date to a specific hour or minute if necessary.

   ```sql
   WHERE `creation_date` BETWEEN TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31 00:00:00') AND TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31 01:00:00')
   ```

2. **Remove Sampling Condition:**

   - If the date range is sufficiently narrow, the sampling condition may not be necessary.

3. **Check Estimated Query Size:**

   - Before running the query, check the "Estimated bytes to be processed" in the BigQuery UI to ensure it is within your quota limits.

**Alternative Approach:**

If you continue to face quota issues, consider the following:

- **Use the Stack Exchange Data Explorer:**

  - Access the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new) to run queries on a public snapshot of StackOverflow data without quota restrictions.

- **Enable Billing:**

  - Enabling billing on your Google Cloud project increases your query quota. BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed, with the first 10 GB per month free.

**Final Answer:**

Given the corrections, here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `title`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
LIMIT 1
```

**Expected Output Format:**

2025-01-20 10:11:22 - root - INFO - I understand that despite multiple adjustments to the SQL query—including narrowing the date range to a specific day (`'2023-10-31'`), applying extreme sampling, and limiting the results to one row—you are still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error. This indicates that querying the `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` table exceeds the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery's free tier, even with these significant restrictions.

---

**Final Answer:**

```csv
Title
title:str (Attention: Unable to retrieve due to data access limitations)
```

---

**Explanation:**

Due to data access limitations and quota restrictions in BigQuery's free tier, we are unable to retrieve the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development across the specified tags such as `android-layout`, `android-activity`, `android-intent`, and others.

Even with extreme query restrictions, the size of the StackOverflow dataset causes the query to exceed the free tier quotas. Accessing this information would require resources beyond the current limitations.

2025-01-20 10:11:48 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when attempting to run the SQL query, even after applying significant restrictions to reduce the amount of data scanned. This indicates that querying the `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` table exceeds the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery's free tier, even with extreme limitations.

---

**Explanation:**

The "Quota exceeded" error occurs because:

- **Dataset Size:** The StackOverflow dataset is substantial. Even minimal queries can scan enough data to surpass the free tier quota.
- **Free Tier Limitations:** BigQuery's free tier has strict limits on the amount of data you can query per day. Details on these quotas can be found in the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas).

---

**Alternative Solutions:**

Given these constraints, here are some alternative approaches to help you obtain the desired information:

### 1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project**

- **Action:** Enable billing to increase your query quota beyond the free tier limitations.
- **Considerations:**
  - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed.
  - The first 10 GB per month is free.

2025-01-20 10:12:49 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:12:49 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering is:

```
400 Syntax error: Expected end of input but got integer literal "1" at [1:12]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Expected end of input but got integer literal "1" at [1:12]
```

This indicates a syntax error at **line 1, character 12** of your SQL query. The parser expected the end of the input but found an unexpected integer literal `"1"`.

Let's examine your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT `title`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2023-10-31'
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(`title`, r'(?i)\bhow\b')
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000000000) = 1
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Use of Raw String Notation (`r''`):**

   - The `r''` notation is used in some programming languages (like Python) to denote raw strings, but it's not valid in BigQuery SQL.
   - In BigQuery, you should use standard string literals and properly escape any special characters.

2. **Regular Expression Syntax:**

   - Special characters like `\b` (word boundary) need to be escaped properly in string literals.
   - In BigQuery, you need to double backslashes to escape special characters in regular expressions.

3. **Date Comparison:**

   - The `creation_date` column is of type `TIMESTAMP`.
   - Comparing a `TIMESTAMP` with a string can cause issues.
   - Use the `TIMESTAMP` function to ensure the date literal is interpreted correctly.

4. **Large Modulus Value:**

   - The modulus value `1000000000000` (one trillion) might be causing issues.
   - While BigQuery supports large integers, using such a large value isn't necessary for sampling.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected SQL query addressing the issues:

```sql
SELECT `title`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(`title`, r'(?i)\\bhow\\b')
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Adjusted `REGEXP_CONTAINS`:**

   - Replaced `r'(?i)\bhow\b'` with `r'(?i)\\bhow\\b'`.
   - In BigQuery, backslashes need to be escaped with another backslash (`\\`).

2. **Date Comparison:**

   - Wrapped the date string with the `TIMESTAMP` function: `TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')`.
   - This ensures the date is interpreted as a `TIMESTAMP` type for accurate comparison.

3. **Reduced Modulus Value:**

   - Adjusted the modulus value from `1000000000000` to `1000000`.
   - This increases the sampling rate, selecting approximately 1 in 1,000,000 records.
   - Using an excessively large modulus might cause performance issues or not select any records.

4. **Function Syntax:**

   - Ensured all functions are correctly nested with proper parentheses.

**Important Note:**

Even after correcting the syntax, it's possible that this query will still **exceed the free query bytes scanned quota** in BigQuery due to the size of the `posts_questions` table. The dataset is substantial, and querying it, even with restrictions, can surpass the free tier limits.

---

**Alternative Solutions:**

Given the persistent quota issues, consider the following options:

### 1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project**

- **Action:** Enable billing to increase your query quota beyond the free tier limitations.
- **Considerations:**
  - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed.

WHERE p.PostTypeId = 1  -- Questions
  AND p.Title LIKE '%how%'
  AND t.TagName IN ('android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent')
ORDER BY p.Score DESC
```

- **Note:** Adjust the syntax if necessary based on the platform.

2025-01-20 10:13:16 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

Despite applying significant query restrictions—including narrowing the `creation_date` to a specific day (`'2023-10-31'`), using a sampling condition with a large modulus, and limiting the results to 1—the "Quota exceeded" error persists. This indicates that even minimal queries on the `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` table are exceeding the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery's free tier.

**Reasons:**

- **Dataset Size:** The StackOverflow dataset is massive, containing millions of records. Even highly restrictive queries can scan a substantial amount of data.
  
- **Free Tier Limitations:** BigQuery's free tier imposes strict limits on the amount of data you can query per day. Details about these quotas can be found in the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#free-tier).

- **Functions and Conditions:** Using functions like `REGEXP_CONTAINS` and `MOD` with large datasets can prevent BigQuery from optimizing the query effectively, leading to full table scans.

- **Date Partitioning:** The table may not be partitioned or clustered on `creation_date`, so filtering by date may not reduce data scanned as significantly as expected.

**Conclusion:**

Given these constraints, we are unable to retrieve the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development within the specified tags using BigQuery under the current limitations.

2025-01-20 10:16:14 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:16:14 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering is:

```
400 Syntax error: Expected end of input but got integer literal "1" at [1:12]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Expected end of input but got integer literal "1" at [1:12]
```

This indicates a **syntax error** in your SQL query at **line 1, character 12**.

Let's look at your query:

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`, `creation_date`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

---

### **1. Invalid Position in Error Message**

The error message refers to a syntax error at **line 1, character 12**.

Counting 12 characters into the first line:

```
123456789012
SELECT `title`
```

Position 12 lands on the **backtick after `title`**, which is valid syntax. This suggests the error message may not point to the exact location of the issue.

---

### **2. Hidden Characters or Formatting Issues**

**Cause:**

- **Hidden or non-printable characters** in your query (e.g., zero-width spaces, non-breaking spaces).
- **Copy-paste artifacts** from text editors or web pages.

**Solution:**

- **Re-type the Query:**
  - Manually re-type the entire query into the BigQuery editor to eliminate any hidden characters.
- **Use a Plain Text Editor:**
  - Paste your query into a plain text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) set to plain text mode, then copy it back into BigQuery.

### **3. Remove or Simplify the Sampling Condition**

**Cause:**

The sampling condition:

```sql
AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
```

might be causing the syntax error due to:

- **Incorrect function usage.**
- **Large modulus value possibly causing issues.**

**Solution:**

- **Simplify or Remove the Sampling Condition:**

  - **Option A: Remove the Sampling Condition Temporarily**

    ```sql
    SELECT `title`, `view_count`, `creation_date`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
      AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
    ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
    LIMIT 1
    ```

    - Test the query without the sampling condition.
    - If it runs successfully, the issue lies within the sampling condition.

  - **Option B: Use a Different Sampling Method**

    - **Use `RAND()` Function for Sampling:**

      ```sql
      SELECT `title`, `view_count`, `creation_date`
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
      WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
        AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
        AND RAND() < 0.000001
      ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
      LIMIT 1
      ```

      - The `RAND()` function returns a random number between 0 and 1.
      - Adjust the threshold (e.g., `0.000001`) to sample a smaller fraction of data.

---

### **4. Validate Date and Timestamp Usage**

**Cause:**

- **Incorrect date comparisons** can cause syntax errors.

**Solution:**

- **Ensure Correct Date Comparison:**
  
  ```sql
  WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
  ```

  - Confirm that `creation_date` is of type `TIMESTAMP`.
  - Use `DATE('YYYY-MM-DD')` if `creation_date` is of type `DATE`.

---

### **5. Check for Incorrect Use of Comments**

**Cause:**

- **Unterminated comments** or comment syntax errors can lead to unexpected parsing issues.

**Solution:**

- **Review Comment Syntax:**
  - Ensure any comments in your query are correctly formatted.
  - Use `--` for single-line comments.
  - Avoid using block comments (`/* */`) within lines of code.

---

### **6. Ensure No Extraneous Characters**

**Cause:**

- Extra characters or incomplete statements can cause syntax errors.

**Solution:**

- **Check for Unintended Characters:**
  - Make sure there's no unintended text before or after your query.
  - Confirm that the query doesn't contain invisible or special characters.

---

### **7. Verify Function Syntax**

**Cause:**

- **Function syntax errors** due to mismatched parentheses or incorrect arguments.

**Solution:**

- **Check the Sampling Condition Syntax:**

  ```sql
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
  ```

  - Ensure all parentheses `()` are correctly matched.
  - All functions used are correctly spelled and used as per BigQuery syntax.

---

### **8. BigQuery Query Parser Limitations**

**Cause:**

- Sometimes, the BigQuery parser may give misleading error messages if it encounters unexpected tokens.

**Solution:**

- **Break Down the Query:**
  - Run parts of the query incrementally to isolate the error.

---

**Proposed Corrected Query:**

Given the potential issues, here's a corrected version of your query using the `RAND()` function for sampling:

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`, `creation_date`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND RAND() < 0.000001  -- Adjust sampling rate as needed
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**Notes:**

- **Sampling with `RAND()`:**
  - This method is simpler and may avoid syntax issues.
  - Adjust the threshold (`0.000001`) to change the sampling rate.

---

**Important Consideration on Quota Limits:**

Even after fixing the syntax error, you may still encounter **"Quota exceeded" errors** due to the size of the dataset and the limitations of the BigQuery free tier.

**Alternative Solutions:**

- **Enable Billing:**
  - Consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your query quota.
  - Monitor your usage to control costs.

- **Use the Stack Exchange Data Explorer:**
  - A free tool to run SQL queries on StackOverflow data without quota issues.
  - [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new)

- **Download the Data for Local Analysis:**
  - Download the StackOverflow data dump to query locally.
  - [Archive.org StackExchange Data Dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange)

---

**Summary:**

- **Syntax Error Resolution:**
  - Re-type your query to eliminate hidden characters.
  - Simplify or adjust the sampling condition.
  - Verify all function syntaxes and parentheses.

- **Quota Limitations:**
  - Be aware that quota limits may still prevent the query from running.
  - Consider alternative methods to access the data.

2025-01-20 10:16:45 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:16:45 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when attempting to run your query, even after applying significant restrictions to reduce the amount of data scanned. This indicates that querying the **`bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`** table exceeds the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery's free tier, even with these limitations.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Dataset Size:** The StackOverflow dataset is substantial, containing millions of records. Even highly restrictive queries can scan enough data to surpass the free tier quota.

- **Quota Limitations:** BigQuery's free tier imposes strict limits on the amount of data you can query per day. Details about these quotas can be found in the [BigQuery documentation on quotas](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#free-tier).

- **Sampling Functions:** Using functions like `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(id AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1` for sampling may not effectively reduce the amount of data scanned because BigQuery still needs to process the entire dataset to apply the function.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

Given these constraints, here are some alternative approaches to help you obtain the desired information:

### 1. **Further Narrow the Date Range**

Limit the query to a specific hour or even minute to reduce the number of rows scanned.

**Example: Limit to a specific hour on '2023-10-31'**

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`, `creation_date`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` BETWEEN TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31 00:00:00') AND TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31 00:59:59')
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 1
```

- **Benefit:** Reducing the date range significantly decreases the data scanned.
- **Note:** Adjust the time frame to when data is most likely to be present.

### 2. **Remove Sampling Functions**

As sampling functions might not reduce data scanned effectively, removing them and relying on a narrow date range can be more efficient.

### 3. **Check Estimated Data Scanned Before Running the Query**

In the BigQuery UI, you can view the estimated bytes to be processed before running the query:

- **Steps:**
  - Paste your query into the BigQuery editor.
  - Look for the "Estimated query cost" or "Estimated bytes scanned" below the editor.
  - Adjust your query until the estimated bytes are within your quota limits.

### 4. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project**

If possible, consider enabling billing to increase your query quota beyond the free tier limitations.

- **Benefits:**
  - Access to higher query quotas.
  - Ability to process larger datasets.
- **Considerations:**
  - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed.
  - The first 10 GB per month is free.
  - Set up budgets and alerts to monitor and control costs.
- **Steps:**
  - Visit the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to set up billing.
  - Ensure you have appropriate cost controls in place.

### 5. **Use the Stack Exchange Data Explorer**

Utilize the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new) to run SQL queries against a public snapshot of StackOverflow data.

- **Benefits:**
  - Free to use with no query quotas.
  - Web-based interface supporting SQL queries.
- **Limitations:**
  - Data may not be as up-to-date as BigQuery's dataset.
  - The SQL dialect and schema might differ slightly.

**Example Query in Stack Exchange Data Explorer:**

```sql
SELECT TOP 1
    p.Title,
    p.ViewCount
FROM Posts AS p
INNER JOIN PostTags AS pt ON p.Id = pt.PostId
INNER JOIN Tags AS t ON pt.TagId = t.Id
WHERE p.PostTypeId = 1  -- Questions
  AND p.Title LIKE '%how%'
  AND t.TagName IN ('android', 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent')
ORDER BY p.ViewCount DESC
```

- **Note:** This query retrieves the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development.

### 6. **Download and Analyze the StackOverflow Data Dump**

Download the [Stack Exchange Data Dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) to perform queries locally.

- **Benefits:**
  - Full control over the data without query quotas.
- **Considerations:**
  - The data dump is large (tens of gigabytes); sufficient storage and computational resources are required.
  - Data may not be as current as BigQuery's dataset.
  - You'll need to set up a local database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to load and query the data.

---

**Conclusion:**

Given the limitations of BigQuery's free tier and the size of the StackOverflow dataset, it may not be feasible to retrieve the requested data using BigQuery without enabling billing.

**Alternative Solution:**

To obtain the desired information without encountering quota issues, you can use the **Stack Exchange Data Explorer**, a free tool that allows you to run SQL queries against a public snapshot of StackOverflow data.

**Steps to Use Stack Exchange Data Explorer:**

1. **Visit the Stack Exchange Data Explorer:**

   [https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new)

2. **Write and Execute Your Query:**

   Here's an example of a query that retrieves the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development across the specified tags:

   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 1
       p.Title,
       p.ViewCount
   FROM Posts AS p
   INNER JOIN PostTags AS pt ON p.Id = pt.PostId
   INNER JOIN Tags AS t ON pt.TagId = t.Id
   WHERE p.PostTypeId = 1  -- Questions
     AND p.Title LIKE '%how%'
     AND t.TagName IN ('android', 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent')
   ORDER BY p.ViewCount DESC
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - **`SELECT TOP 1`:** Retrieves the top result with the highest view count.
     - **`p.Title, p.ViewCount`:** Selects the title and view count of the question.
     - **`FROM Posts AS p`:** Accesses the `Posts` table, aliased as `p`.
     - **`INNER JOIN PostTags AS pt ON p.Id = pt.PostId`:** Joins the `PostTags` table to link posts and tags.
     - **`INNER JOIN Tags AS t ON pt.TagId = t.Id`:** Joins the `Tags` table to get tag names.
     - **`WHERE p.PostTypeId = 1`:** Filters for questions (as opposed to answers or other post types).
     - **`AND p.Title LIKE '%how%'`:** Filters titles containing 'how'.
     - **`AND t.TagName IN (...)`:** Filters for the specified Android-related tags.
     - **`ORDER BY p.ViewCount DESC`:** Orders results by view count in descending order.

3. **Review the Results:**

   - After running the query, the result will display the title and view count of the most viewed question matching your criteria.
   - You can modify the query to include additional tags or adjust the search term as needed.

---

**Note:**

- The Stack Exchange Data Explorer uses a different SQL dialect than BigQuery, and the schema may vary slightly. The example query above is tailored for the Data Explorer environment.
- The data available in the Stack Exchange Data Explorer may not be as current as the data in BigQuery. The Data Explorer is updated periodically, so the results reflect the data available at the time of the last update.

2025-01-20 10:18:06 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:18:06 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering is:

```
400 Syntax error: Expected end of input but got integer literal "1" at [1:12]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Expected end of input but got integer literal "1" at [1:12]
```

This indicates a **syntax error** in your SQL query at **line 1, character 12**. Specifically, the parser expected the end of the input but found an unexpected integer literal `"1"`.

**Analyzing Your Query:**

Let's examine your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**Possible Causes of the Error:**

1. **Hidden or Invalid Characters Before the Query:**

   - The error at **line 1, character 12** suggests that the parser is encountering an unexpected character early in the query.
   - There might be an **extra character** or a **hidden character** (like a non-printable character) before the `SELECT` statement.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that there are no hidden characters or extra text before the `SELECT` keyword. It might help to retype the query manually.

2. **Incorrect Use of Backticks and Quotes:**

   - BigQuery uses backticks `` ` `` to enclose identifiers like column and table names.
   - Make sure that there are no mismatched backticks or quotes in your query.

3. **Previous Incomplete Statement:**

   - If you're running the query in an environment where previous statements may not have been terminated properly, it could cause syntax errors.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that any previous queries or statements are properly terminated and that you're starting with a fresh query.

4. **Issue with the Sampling Function:**

   - Although the sampling function is syntactically correct, if it's causing issues, consider removing it temporarily to see if the error persists.
   - **Solution:** Try running the query without the sampling condition to isolate the problem.

5. **Formatting Issues:**

   - Sometimes, copy-pasting queries from different sources introduces formatting issues.
   - **Solution:** Paste the query into a plain text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) to remove any formatting, then copy it back into the BigQuery editor.

**Steps to Resolve the Error:**

1. **Re-type the Query Manually:**

   - Manually retype the entire query in the BigQuery editor to eliminate any hidden or invalid characters.

2. **Simplify the Query:**

   - Start with a simple version of the query to see if it runs without errors, then gradually add conditions back in.
   - **Example:**

     ```sql
     SELECT `title`, `view_count`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
     LIMIT 1
     ```

   - If this runs successfully, add the `WHERE` clause back in step by step.

3. **Check for Hidden Characters Before the Query:**

   - Ensure there is no text or characters before the `SELECT` statement.

4. **Verify the BigQuery Editor Settings:**

   - Check if the SQL dialect is set correctly in the editor (should be Standard SQL for BigQuery).

**Alternative Query Without the Sampling Function:**

Try running the query without the sampling condition:

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 1
```

- **Note:** This query may scan more data, potentially leading to the "Quota exceeded" error. If it runs successfully, the issue might be related to the sampling function.

**Alternative Sampling Method:**

If the sampling function is causing issues, consider using the `RAND()` function for sampling:

```sql
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
  AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
  AND RAND() < 0.000001  -- Adjust the value to change the sampling rate
ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**Important Consideration:**

Even after resolving the syntax error, you might still encounter the "Quota exceeded" error due to the size of the dataset and the limitations of BigQuery's free tier.

**Alternative Solutions:**

- **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

  - Enabling billing increases your query quota.
  - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed.
  - The first 10 GB per month is free.
  - Set up budgets and alerts to monitor costs.

    INNER JOIN Tags AS t ON pt.TagId = t.Id
    WHERE p.PostTypeId = 1  -- Questions
      AND p.Title LIKE '%how%'
      AND t.TagName IN ('android', 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent')
    ORDER BY p.ViewCount DESC
    ```

  - **Note:** The SQL dialect and schema may differ from BigQuery.

- **Download and Query Locally:**

  - Download the [Stack Exchange Data Dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange).
  - Set up a local database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to query the data.
  - Requires sufficient storage and computational resources.

**Summary:**

```

**Possible Causes of the Error:**

1. **Hidden or Invalid Characters Before the Query:**

   The error at line 1, character 12 suggests that the parser is encountering an unexpected character early in the query. There might be an **extra character** or **hidden character** (like a non-printable character) before the `SELECT` statement.

   **Solution:**

2. **Incorrect Use of Backticks and Quotes:**

   Ensure that all backticks `` ` `` and quotes `'` are correctly matched and properly placed.

3. **Copy-Paste Artifacts:**

   Sometimes, copying and pasting queries from other sources introduces formatting issues or hidden characters.

   **Solution:**

   - **Use a Plain Text Editor:** Copy your query into a plain text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) set to plain text mode, then copy it back into the BigQuery editor.

4. **Previous Incomplete Statements:**

   If you're running the query in an environment where previous statements might not have been properly terminated, it could cause this error.

   **Solution:**

   - **Start Fresh:** Ensure that you're running the query in a new session or after clearing any previous commands.

**Steps to Resolve the Error:**

1. **Simplify the Query:**

   Start by running a minimal version of the query to see if the error persists.

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   LIMIT 1
   ```

   - If this runs successfully, gradually add back the `WHERE` clauses to identify where the error occurs.

2. **Test Each Condition Individually:**

   Add each condition one at a time and run the query to see if it causes an error.

   **Add the Date Filter:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
   LIMIT 1
   ```

   **Add the Tags Filter:**

   ```sql
   ... (include the previous condition)
   AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
   ```

   **Add the Sampling Condition:**

   ```sql
   ... (include previous conditions)
   AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`id` AS STRING))), 1000000) = 1
   ```

   - This helps pinpoint which part of the query is causing the syntax error.

3. **Alternative Sampling Method:**

   If the sampling condition is causing issues, try an alternative method.

   **Using the `RAND()` Function:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE `creation_date` >= TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31')
     AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
     AND RAND() < 0.000001  -- Adjust the value to change the sampling rate
   ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
   LIMIT 1
   ```

   - The `RAND()` function generates a random number between 0 and 1. By selecting rows where `RAND()` is less than a small threshold, you effectively sample the data.

**Important Note on Quota Limitations:**

Even if the syntax error is resolved, you may still encounter the **"Quota exceeded"** error due to the size of the dataset and the limitations of BigQuery's free tier.

- The **`posts_questions`** table is very large, and applying functions like `FARM_FINGERPRINT` or `RAND()` does not reduce the amount of data scanned because BigQuery needs to process the entire table to evaluate these functions.
- The **`LIMIT`** clause only limits the number of rows returned, not the amount of data scanned during query execution.

**Alternative Solutions:**

1. **Further Narrow the Date Range:**

   Limit the query to a specific hour or minute to reduce the number of rows scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE `creation_date` BETWEEN TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31 00:00:00') AND TIMESTAMP('2023-10-31 00:59:59')
     AND `tags` LIKE '%<android>%'
   ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
   LIMIT 1
   ```

2. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   - **Action:** Enable billing to increase your query quota beyond the free tier limitations.
   - **Benefits:** You can run the full query without exceeding quota limits.
   - **Considerations:** Be mindful of potential costs. BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed, with the first 10 GB per month free.
   - **Steps:** Visit the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to set up billing.

3. **Use the Stack Exchange Data Explorer:**

   - **Website:** [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new)
   - **Example Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT TOP 1
         p.Title,
         p.ViewCount
     FROM Posts AS p
     INNER JOIN PostTags AS pt ON p.Id = pt.PostId
     INNER JOIN Tags AS t ON pt.TagId = t.Id
     WHERE p.PostTypeId = 1  -- Questions
       AND p.Title LIKE '%how%'
       AND t.TagName IN ('android', 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent')
     ORDER BY p.ViewCount DESC
     ```

     - **Note:** The Stack Exchange Data Explorer uses a different SQL dialect, and the schema may differ from BigQuery.

4. **Download and Analyze the Data Locally:**

   - Download the [Stack Exchange Data Dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) to perform queries locally.
   - Requires setting up a local database and may involve significant storage and processing resources.

**Summary:**

- The syntax error may be due to hidden or invalid characters. Retyping the query manually and simplifying it can help isolate and resolve the issue.
- BigQuery's free tier limitations may prevent you from running the query, even after fixing the syntax error.
- Alternative methods, such as enabling billing or using the Stack Exchange Data Explorer, can help you access the data.

  - **`title`**: The title of the question.
    - *Potential usage*: To filter questions containing 'how'.

  - **`tags`**: The tags associated with the question.
    - *Potential usage*: To filter questions tagged with specified tags like 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', etc.

  - **`view_count`**: The number of times the question has been viewed.
    - *Potential usage*: To find the most viewed question.

  - **`score`**: The score of the question.
    - *Potential usage*: To assess the popularity or quality of the question.

  - **`creation_date`**: The date the question was created.
    - *Potential usage*: To analyze questions within a specific time frame.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Title contains 'how'** (case-insensitive):
  - `LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'`

- **Tags include specified Android-related tags**:
  - `LOWER(tags) LIKE '%<android-layout>%')`
  - `LOWER(tags) LIKE '%<android-activity>%')`
  - `LOWER(tags) LIKE '%<android-intent>%')`
  - (Include other tags as needed, ensuring tags are enclosed in angle brackets)

1. **Select sample question titles containing 'how' (case-insensitive):**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct tags related to Android:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `tags`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android>%'
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

3. **Get the top 1000 most viewed questions tagged with 'android':**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android>%'
   ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

4. **Retrieve questions containing 'how' and tagged with 'android-layout':**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `tags`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
     AND LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

5. **Find view counts for questions with 'how' in the title and 'android-activity' tag:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
     AND LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

6. **List questions with 'how' in the title and any specified Android tags:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `tags`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
     AND (
       LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
       OR LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
       OR LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
       -- Add other tags as needed
     )
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

7. **Retrieve distinct titles of questions tagged with 'android-intent':**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `title`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

8. **Get titles and scores of questions containing 'how' and tagged with 'android':**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `score`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
     AND LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android>%'
   ORDER BY `score` DESC
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `creation_date`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
     AND LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android>%'
     AND `creation_date` > '2020-01-01'
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

10. **Retrieve view counts of questions tagged with 'android' and their creation dates:**

    SELECT `title`, `view_count`, `creation_date`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE LOWER(`tags`) LIKE '%<android>%'
    ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
    LIMIT 1000
    ```

These queries help explore the relevant data and understand the values in the related columns. They focus on questions containing "how" in the title, tagged with Android-related tags, and retrieve information like titles, tags, view counts, scores, and creation dates.

---

**Note:** When filtering by tags in StackOverflow data, tags are usually stored as a string containing the tags enclosed in angle brackets and concatenated together (e.g., `"<android><android-layout><java>"`). Therefore, when searching for a specific tag, it's important to include the angle brackets in the `LIKE` condition and use `%` wildcards appropriately.Query:
SELECT `title`, `view_count`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%how%'
     AND (
       `tags` LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
       OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
       OR `tags` LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
     )
     AND `creation_date` >= '2022-01-01'
   ORDER BY `view_count` DESC
   LIMIT 1000

Task: What is the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, across specified tags such as 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', and others

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Title
title:str(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This represents the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, across the specified tags such as 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', and others..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'stackoverflow': ['badges', 'comments', 'post_history', 'post_links', 'posts_answers', 'posts_moderator_nomination', 'posts_orphaned_tag_wiki', 'posts_privilege_wiki', 'posts_questions', 'posts_tag_wiki', 'posts_tag_wiki_excerpt', 'posts_wiki_placeholder', 'stackoverflow_posts', 'tags', 'users', 'votes']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
