**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `isb-cgc-bq.pancancer_atlas.Filtered_clinical_PANCAN_patient_with_followup`
   - **bcr_patient_barcode:** Unique patient identifier; used to match with mutation data.
   - **disease_code:** Cancer type code; used to select patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD).
   - **acronym:** TCGA study abbreviation; can also be used to identify PAAD patients.

2. **Table:** `isb-cgc-bq.pancancer_atlas.Filtered_MC3_MAF_V5_one_per_tumor_sample`
   - **ParticipantBarcode:** Unique patient identifier; used to match with clinical data.
   - **Hugo_Symbol:** Gene symbol; used to identify mutations in KRAS and TP53 genes.
   - **Variant_Classification:** Type of mutation (e.g., Missense_Mutation); used to filter for functional mutations.
   - **Study:** TCGA study abbreviation; used to filter mutations from PAAD patients.

**Potential Conditions:**

- **Disease Code = 'PAAD':** Selects patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
- **Hugo_Symbol IN ('KRAS', 'TP53'):** Filters mutations in the KRAS and TP53 genes.
- **Variant_Classification NOT IN ('Silent', 'Intron', 'IGR', '3'UTR', '5'UTR', '3'Flank', '5'Flank'):** Excludes non-functional mutations.
- **Matching Barcodes:** Ensures data integrity by matching patient identifiers across tables.

These queries are designed to explore the relevant data, understand the distribution of KRAS and TP53 mutations among PAAD patients, and prepare for the chi-squared statistical analysis. By examining mutation occurrences, co-occurrences, and patient counts, we can accurately assess the association between mutations in these two genes within the pancreatic adenocarcinoma population.Query:

Task: Using TCGA dataset, calculate the chi-squared statistic to evaluate the association between KRAS and TP53 gene mutations in patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Incorporate clinical follow-up data and high-quality mutation annotations to accurately determine the frequency of patients with co-occurring KRAS and TP53 mutations compared to those with each mutation occurring independently. Ensure that patient records are meticulously matched based on unique identifiers to maintain data integrity. This analysis aims to identify and quantify potential correlations between KRAS and TP53 genetic alterations within the PAAD patient population.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
KRAS_mutation_status,TP53_mutation_status,Number_of_patients
Mutated,Mutated,count1:int
Mutated,Not_Mutated,count2:int
Not_Mutated,Mutated,count3:int
Not_Mutated,Not_Mutated,count4:int
```

**Explanation:**

To evaluate the association between **KRAS** and **TP53** gene mutations in patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - **Select PAAD Patients:** Filter the TCGA dataset to include only patients with a diagnosis of PAAD.
   - **High-Quality Mutations:** Incorporate mutation annotations from reliable sources, ensuring that only high-confidence mutations are considered.
   - **Clinical Follow-Up Data:** Use clinical data to verify the mutation status and exclude any ambiguous cases.
   - **Unique Identifiers:** Ensure all patient records are matched accurately using unique identifiers like `ParticipantBarcode`.

2. **Construct the Contingency Table:**
   - **Categorize Patients:** Divide patients into groups based on the presence or absence of mutations in the **KRAS** and **TP53** genes.
   - **Count Frequencies:** Calculate the number of patients in each category to fill in `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, and `count4` in the table above.

3. **Compute the Chi-Squared Statistic:**
   - **Expected Frequencies:** Calculate the expected frequencies for each category assuming no association between the genes.
   - **Chi-Squared Calculation:** Use the formula:

     \[
     \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
     \]

     where \( O \) is the observed frequency and \( E \) is the expected frequency.
   - **Degrees of Freedom:** Calculate degrees of freedom (df). For a 2x2 table, df = (2-1)*(2-1) = 1.
   - **P-Value:** Determine the p-value associated with the calculated chi-squared statistic to assess statistical significance.

4. **Interpretation:**
   - **Significant Association:** A low p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates a significant association between KRAS and TP53 mutations.
   - **Conclusion:** Based on the chi-squared test results, conclude whether mutations in KRAS and TP53 genes are statistically associated in PAAD patients.

**Note:** Replace `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, and `count4` with the actual patient counts obtained from your analysis to perform the chi-squared test..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'isb-cgc-bq': {'pancancer_atlas': ['BarcodeMap', 'Filtered_EBpp_AdjustPANCAN_IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2_genExp', 'Filtered_MC3_MAF_V5_one_per_tumor_sample', 'Filtered_TCGA_RPPA_pancan_clean', 'Filtered_all_CNVR_data_by_gene', 'Filtered_clinical_PANCAN_patient_with_followup', 'Filtered_jhu_usc_edu_PANCAN_HumanMethylation27_betaValue_whitelisted', 'Filtered_jhu_usc_edu_PANCAN_HumanMethylation450_betaValue_whitelisted', 'Filtered_jhu_usc_edu_PANCAN_merged_HumanMethylation27_HumanMethylation450_betaValue_whitelisted', 'Filtered_pancanMiRs_EBadjOnProtocolPlatformWithoutRepsWithUnCorrectMiRs_08_04_16', 'Original_EBpp_AdjustPANCAN_IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2_genExp', 'Original_TCGA_RPPA_pancan_clean', 'Original_clinical_PANCAN_patient_with_followup', 'Original_jhu_usc_edu_PANCAN_HumanMethylation27_betaValue_whitelisted', 'Original_jhu_usc_edu_PANCAN_HumanMethylation450_betaValue_whitelisted', 'Original_jhu_usc_edu_PANCAN_merged_HumanMethylation27_HumanMethylation450_betaValue_whitelisted', 'Original_pancanMiRs_EBadjOnProtocolPlatformWithoutRepsWithUnCorrectMiRs_08_04_16', 'TCGA_CDR', 'TCGA_Clinical_Data_Resource_Extra', 'Whitelist_ParticipantBarcodes', 'merged_sample_quality_annotations']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

     where \( O \) is the observed frequency and \( E \) is the expected frequency.
   - **Degrees of Freedom:** Calculate degrees of freedom (df). For a 2x2 table, df = (2-1)*(2-1) = 1.
   - **P-Value:** Determine the p-value associated with the calculated chi-squared statistic to assess statistical significance.

4. **Interpretation:**

   - **Conclusion:** Based on the chi-squared test results, conclude whether mutations in KRAS and TP53 genes are statistically associated in PAAD patients.

**Note:** Replace `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, and `count4` with the actual patient counts obtained from your analysis to perform the chi-squared test. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
