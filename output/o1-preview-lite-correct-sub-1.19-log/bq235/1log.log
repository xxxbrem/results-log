**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **List distinct providers from inpatient data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT provider_id, provider_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **List distinct providers from outpatient data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT provider_id, provider_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`

   ```

3. **View inpatient average total payments:**
   ```sql
   SELECT provider_id, provider_name, average_total_payments
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE average_total_payments IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **View outpatient average total payments:**
   ```sql
   SELECT provider_id, provider_name, average_total_payments
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE average_total_payments IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Check the range of inpatient average total payments:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(average_total_payments) AS min_payment, MAX(average_total_payments) AS max_payment
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`;
   ```

6. **Check the range of outpatient average total payments:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(average_total_payments) AS min_payment, MAX(average_total_payments) AS max_payment
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`;
   ```

7. **List inpatient records for a specific provider:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE provider_id = '010001'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **List outpatient records for a specific provider:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE provider_id = '010001'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Count the number of inpatient records per provider:**
   ```sql
   SELECT provider_id, COUNT(*) AS record_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   GROUP BY provider_id
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Count the number of outpatient records per provider:**
    ```sql
    SELECT provider_id, COUNT(*) AS record_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
    GROUP BY provider_id
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Find providers present in both datasets:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT a.provider_id
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014` AS a
    INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014` AS b
    ON a.provider_id = b.provider_id
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **List the top 10 inpatient average total payments:**
    ```sql
    SELECT provider_id, provider_name, average_total_payments
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`

    ```

15. **View distinct APC codes in outpatient data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT apc
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

16. **Check for NULL values in inpatient average total payments:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
    WHERE average_total_payments IS NULL;
    ```

17. **Check for NULL values in outpatient average total payments:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
    WHERE average_total_payments IS NULL;
    ```

18. **View provider locations from inpatient data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT provider_id, provider_city, provider_state
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

19. **View provider locations from outpatient data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT provider_id, provider_city, provider_state
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

20. **List providers with highest number of discharges in inpatient data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT provider_id, provider_name, total_discharges
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
    ORDER BY total_discharges DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of `average_total_payments`, identifying providers present in both datasets, and examining the values of relevant columns needed to determine the healthcare provider with the highest combined average costs for both inpatient and outpatient services in 2014.Query:

Task: Can you tell me which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
provider_id,provider_name,combined_average_total_payments
id:str,name:str,value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the healthcare provider with the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014, we combined the average total payments from both `inpatient_charges_2014` and `outpatient_charges_2014` datasets for each provider and identified the provider with the highest combined average total payments..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 04:59:41 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you tell me which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
provider_id,provider_name,combined_average_total_payments
id:str,name:str,value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the healthcare provider with the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014, we combined the average total payments from both `inpatient_charges_2014` and `outpatient_charges_2014` datasets for each provider and identified the provider with the highest combined average total payments. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
