Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`

  **Columns and Potential Usage:**

  - **`drug_name`**: Used to identify drugs; essential for grouping and aggregating prescription data by drug.
  - **`nppes_provider_state`**: Represents the state where the provider is located; used to filter data by state (e.g., `'NY'` for New York).
  - **`total_claim_count`**: Indicates the number of Medicare Part D claims; used to calculate the total number of prescriptions.
  - **`total_drug_cost`**: Shows the aggregate cost paid for all claims; used to calculate total spending on drugs.
  - **`bene_count`**: Number of Medicare beneficiaries; can be used to understand the reach of a drug among patients.
  - **`generic_name`**: Provides the generic name of the drug; useful for aggregating data by generic drugs.
  - **`nppes_provider_city`**: City of the provider; could be used for more granular geographic analysis if needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter by State**: `nppes_provider_state = 'NY'` (to focus on New York State).
- **Filter by Drug**: `drug_name = 'DrugName'` (to focus on a specific drug identified in the analysis).
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: Using `GROUP BY` to aggregate data by drug or state.
- **Sorting**: Using `ORDER BY` to rank results (e.g., highest to lowest total claim counts).
- **Limiting Results**: Using `LIMIT` to restrict the number of rows returned (e.g., top 10 drugs).

These queries explore the relevant data needed to identify:

- The drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014.
- The top five states with the highest total claim counts for that drug.
- The total claim counts and total drug costs associated with that drug in each state.

By executing these queries, one can gain insights into prescription patterns, drug costs, and the geographic distribution of drug claims, which are essential for addressing the task at hand.Query:

Task: For the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, could you list the top five states with the highest total claim counts for this drug? Please also include their total claim counts and total drug costs. 

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top five states with the highest total claim counts for the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, we aggregate the prescription data from the `part_d_prescriber_2014` table. We first identify the drug with the highest total claim count in New York State and then compute the total claim counts and total drug costs for that drug across all states. Here is the requested information:

```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
state1:str,claim_count1:int,drug_cost1:float
state2:str,claim_count2:int,drug_cost2:float
state3:str,claim_count3:int,drug_cost3:float
state4:str,claim_count4:int,drug_cost4:float
state5:str,claim_count5:int,drug_cost5:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the top five states with the highest total claim counts for the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, we aggregate the prescription data from the `part_d_prescriber_2014` table. We first identify the drug with the highest total claim count in New York State and then compute the total claim counts and total drug costs for that drug across all states. Here is the requested information:

```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
state1:str,claim_count1:int,drug_cost1:float
state2:str,claim_count2:int,drug_cost2:float
state3:str,claim_count3:int,drug_cost3:float
state4:str,claim_count4:int,drug_cost4:float
state5:str,claim_count5:int,drug_cost5:float
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-20 04:22:24 - root - INFO - To determine the top five states with the highest total claim counts for the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, we perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the top drug in New York State**: We query the `part_d_prescriber_2014` table to find the drug with the highest total claim count (`total_claim_count`) where `nppes_provider_state` is 'NY'. The drug identified is **'AMLODIPINE BESYLATE'**.

2. **Aggregate data for that drug across all states**: We then compute the total claim counts and total drug costs for 'AMLODIPINE BESYLATE' across all states and list the top five states based on the total claim counts.

Here is the requested information:

```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
CA,3725846,35073534.8700
FL,2689327,21046051.1900
NY,2606392,20729281.2500
TX,2212275,17513523.7000
PA,1760543,14121212.7400
```

Here is the SQL query that performs these steps:

```sql
SELECT 
  `nppes_provider_state` AS State, 
  SUM(`total_claim_count`) AS Total_Claim_Count, 
  SUM(`total_drug_cost`) AS Total_Drug_Cost
FROM

    WHERE 
      `nppes_provider_state` = 'NY'
    GROUP BY 
      `drug_name`
    ORDER BY 
      SUM(`total_claim_count`) DESC
    LIMIT 
      1
  )
GROUP BY 
  `nppes_provider_state`
ORDER BY 
  Total_Claim_Count DESC
