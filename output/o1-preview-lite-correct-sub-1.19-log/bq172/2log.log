**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `nppes_provider_state`: To filter records by state (e.g., 'NY' for New York).
- `drug_name`: To identify the drugs prescribed.
- `total_claim_count`: To calculate the total number of prescriptions (claims) for each drug.
- `total_drug_cost`: To calculate the total cost of each drug.
- `nppes_provider_city`: To explore prescribing patterns in different cities.
- `specialty_description`: To analyze prescribing patterns by provider specialty.
- `generic_name`: To group prescriptions by generic drug names.
- `npi`: National Provider Identifier, to identify unique providers.
- `bene_count`: Number of unique Medicare beneficiaries.
- `total_day_supply`: Total days supply for all claims, to understand prescription durations.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- `nppes_provider_state = 'NY'` to filter for New York State.
- Grouping by `drug_name` to aggregate data per drug.
- Ordering by `total_claim_count` in descending order to find the most prescribed drugs.
- Using `LIMIT` to restrict the number of results.

2. **Get total claim counts for each drug in New York State:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `drug_name`, SUM(`total_claim_count`) AS total_claims
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE `nppes_provider_state` = 'NY'
   GROUP BY `drug_name`
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Find the top 10 drugs by total drug cost in New York State:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `drug_name`, SUM(`total_drug_cost`) AS total_cost
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE `nppes_provider_state` = 'NY'
   GROUP BY `drug_name`
   ORDER BY total_cost DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **List providers in New York who prescribed a specific drug (e.g., 'Lisinopril'):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `npi`, `nppes_provider_last_org_name`, `nppes_provider_first_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE `nppes_provider_state` = 'NY' AND LOWER(`drug_name`) = 'lisinopril'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Get total claim counts per state for a specific drug (e.g., 'Levothyroxine Sodium'):**
   ```sql
   SELECT `nppes_provider_state`, SUM(`total_claim_count`) AS total_claims
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE LOWER(`drug_name`) = 'levothyroxine sodium'
   GROUP BY `nppes_provider_state`
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Find the total number of providers per state:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `nppes_provider_state`, COUNT(DISTINCT `npi`) AS provider_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`

Task: For the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, could you list the top five states with the highest total claim counts for this drug? Please also include their total claim counts and total drug costs. 

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top five states with the highest total claim counts for the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, we aggregate the prescription data from the `part_d_prescriber_2014` table. We first identify the drug with the highest total claim count in New York State and then compute the total claim counts and total drug costs for that drug across all states. Here is the requested information:

```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
state1:str,claim_count1:int,drug_cost1:float
state2:str,claim_count2:int,drug_cost2:float
state3:str,claim_count3:int,drug_cost3:float
state4:str,claim_count4:int,drug_cost4:float
state5:str,claim_count5:int,drug_cost5:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 04:21:56 - root - INFO - To determine the top five states with the highest total claim counts for the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, we perform the following steps:

1. Identify the top prescribed drug in New York State by summing up the total claim counts per drug and selecting the one with the highest total.
2. Using this drug, aggregate the total claim counts and total drug costs for each state.
3. Order the results by total claim counts in descending order and select the top five states.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql

If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the top five states with the highest total claim counts for the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, we aggregate the prescription data from the `part_d_prescriber_2014` table. We first identify the drug with the highest total claim count in New York State and then compute the total claim counts and total drug costs for that drug across all states. Here is the requested information:

```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
state1:str,claim_count1:int,drug_cost1:float
state2:str,claim_count2:int,drug_cost2:float
state3:str,claim_count3:int,drug_cost3:float
state4:str,claim_count4:int,drug_cost4:float
state5:str,claim_count5:int,drug_cost5:float
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

       ROUND(SUM(`total_drug_cost`), 4) AS Total_Drug_Cost
