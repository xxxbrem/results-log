After comparing the provided SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the following reasons:

**Reasoning:**

- **Case Sensitivity in the `descript` Field:**
  - **`2result.sql`** uses `LOWER(descript) = 'public intoxication'` in the `WHERE` clause. This approach ensures that all incidents are captured regardless of any variations in the letter casing of the `descript` field (e.g., 'Public Intoxication', 'PUBLIC INTOXICATION', 'public intoxication'). This leads to a more comprehensive and accurate count of incidents.
  - **`0result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`** use `descript = 'PUBLIC INTOXICATION'`, which may exclude records where the `descript` is not in all uppercase letters, potentially missing some incidents and affecting the accuracy of the results.

- **Accurate Z-Score Calculation:**
  - All three queries calculate the Z-scores for daily incident counts correctly. However, **`2result.sql`** ensures the dataset used for calculation is more accurate due to the comprehensive filtering mentioned above.

- **Consistent Logic:**
  - **`2result.sql`** follows standard SQL practices by using `CROSS JOIN` for the statistics and performs ordering and limiting to find the date with the second highest Z-score.

Given the above reasons, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that accurately identifies the date with the second highest Z-score for daily counts of 'PUBLIC INTOXICATION' incidents in Austin for the year 2016.
