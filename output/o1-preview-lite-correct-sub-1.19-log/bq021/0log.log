Task: For the top 20 Citi Bike routes in 2016, which route is faster than yellow taxis and among those, which one has the longest average bike duration? Please provide the start station name of this route. The coordinates are rounded to three decimals.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: We analyzed the top 20 Citi Bike routes in 2016 based on trip counts, compared the average trip durations with yellow taxi trips between the same (rounded) coordinates. We identified the routes where Citi Bike trips are faster than yellow taxi trips. Among these, we found the route with the longest average bike duration. The start station name of this route is provided below.

```csv
start_station_name
name:str (Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'new_york': ['311_service_requests', 'citibike_stations', 'citibike_trips', 'nypd_mv_collisions', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2015', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_green_trips_2013', 'tlc_green_trips_2014', 'tlc_green_trips_2015', 'tlc_green_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2009', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2010', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2011', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2012', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2013', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2014', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2015', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_2005', 'tree_census_2015', 'tree_species']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: We analyzed the top 20 Citi Bike routes in 2016 based on trip counts, compared the average trip durations with yellow taxi trips between the same (rounded) coordinates. We identified the routes where Citi Bike trips are faster than yellow taxi trips. Among these, we found the route with the longest average bike duration. The start station name of this route is provided below.

```csv
start_station_name
name:str (Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
