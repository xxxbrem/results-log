```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reason:**

The SQL query in `1result.sql` correctly calculates the number of pseudo users who were active in the first five days (January 1 to January 5, 2021) but inactive in the last two days (January 6 and January 7, 2021), as of January 7, 2021.

**Explanation:**

- **Correctness:** The query selects all `user_pseudo_id` from the events tables of the first five days and combines them using `UNION ALL`. It then uses `EXCEPT DISTINCT` to exclude any `user_pseudo_id` that appear in the events tables of the last two days. This effectively identifies users active in the first five days but inactive in the last two.

- **Use of `COUNT(DISTINCT user_pseudo_id)`:** By counting the distinct `user_pseudo_id` in the resulting set, the query accurately provides the number of unique pseudo users fitting the criteria.

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** Compared to the other queries, `1result.sql` is more concise and avoids unnecessary subqueries and `WITH` clauses. It directly performs the required operations in a straightforward manner, which can improve query performance and readability.

**Comparison with Other SQL Queries:**

- **`0result.sql`:** While it also obtains the correct result, it uses additional `WITH` clauses and `UNION DISTINCT`, which can be less efficient due to the extra steps involved in handling common table expressions and ensuring distinctness at each level.

- **`2result.sql`:** This query introduces extra `DISTINCT` operations both before and after the `EXCEPT DISTINCT`. Although it produces the correct result, the additional `DISTINCT` operations may introduce unnecessary overhead.

**Conclusion:**

Choosing `1result.sql` provides a correct, efficient, and clear solution to the problem, making it the preferred SQL query among the options provided.
