2025-01-20 14:08:13 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the closing quote around the end date `'2020-12-31` is a backtick (\`) instead of a single quote (').

Here's the problematic line:

```sql
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31`
```

To fix the error, replace the backtick with a single quote at the end of `'2020-12-31'`. The corrected line should be:

```sql
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 1000;
```

I apologize for the typo in the previous query. This correction should resolve the syntax error you're encountering.

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks:** In SQL, string literals should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`. Backticks \`...\` are used to enclose identifiers like column names or table names that might conflict with reserved words or contain special characters.
- **Unclosed String Literal:** The mismatched quotation mark caused the SQL parser to interpret the string literal as unclosed, leading to the syntax error.

**Recommendation:**

- Always ensure that string literals are properly enclosed with matching single quotes.
- Double-check the use of backticks and single quotes to prevent similar errors.

**Additional Check:**

Reviewing the other queries, here are any necessary corrections:

1. **Query 2 (List Distinct Months with PM2.5 FRM Data in 2020):**

   Correct the backtick at the end.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Query 3 (Retrieve PM2.5 Non-FRM Daily Averages):**

   ```sql
   SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`

However, the error message you're receiving indicates that your project has exceeded the quota for free query bytes scanned in BigQuery, not just a syntax error.

---

**Explanation of the Error:**

- **Error Message:** `Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.`

- **Meaning:** BigQuery provides a free tier that allows up to 1 TB of data processing per month. If your queries collectively exceed this limit, you'll encounter this quota error.

**Reasons and Solutions:**

1. **Amount of Data Scanned:**

   - **BigQuery Billing Model:** BigQuery charges (and applies quotas) based on the amount of data scanned, not the number of rows returned. Even with a `LIMIT 1000` clause, if the query scans a large table, it may exceed your free quota.

2. **Possible Solutions:**

   - **Reduce the Date Range:**

     Try querying a smaller date range to reduce the amount of data scanned.

     ```sql
     SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
     WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   - **Partitioned Tables:**

     Check if the table is partitioned by `date_local`. Using partitioned columns in your `WHERE` clause can significantly reduce the data scanned.

   - **Estimate Data to Be Scanned:**

     Before running the query, use BigQuery's query validator to estimate how much data will be processed.

3. **Check Your Quota Usage:**

   - **Review Usage:**

     In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the BigQuery section and check your project's usage. This will help you confirm if you've exceeded the free tier quota.

4. **Enable Billing:**

   - **Upgrade Quota:**

     If your project requires processing large datasets, consider enabling billing and setting up a budget. This allows you to process more data while controlling costs.

5. **Optimize Your Query:**

   - **Select Only Necessary Columns:**

     You're already selecting specific columns, which helps reduce data scanned.

   - **Additional Filters:**

     If possible, add more filters to narrow down the data further.

**Additional Information:**

- **Understanding BigQuery Quotas:**

  - Free tier limits can be found in the BigQuery documentation under "Quotas and limits."
  - The free tier allows up to 1 TB of query data processing per month.

**Recommendations:**

- **Short-Term Solution:**

  - Modify your query to process a smaller subset of data, such as querying for a single month or week.

- **Long-Term Solution:**

  - If you need to analyze larger datasets regularly, consider enabling billing for your project and configuring budget alerts to manage costs.

**Example of a Reduced Query:**

Querying for the month of January 2020:

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This reduced date range should scan less data and may run without exceeding your quota.

---

**Summary:**

- **Syntax Correction:** Ensure all string literals are properly closed with single quotes.
- **Quota Exceeded:** Your project has surpassed the free query data processing limit.
- **Solution:** Reduce the data scanned by narrowing the date range or consider enabling billing for larger queries.

Feel free to let me know if you need further assistance with adjusting your queries or understanding BigQuery quotas.
2025-01-20 14:09:38 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 14:09:38 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your project has exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/troubleshoot-quotas
```

**Explanation:**

- **BigQuery Billing Model:** BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the amount of data scanned during a query, not the number of rows returned. Even if you use `LIMIT 1000`, the query processes the entire dataset to filter and compute the results before applying the limit.
- **Free Tier Quota:** Google Cloud provides a free tier quota of 1 TB (terabyte) of data processed per month per billing account. If your queries cumulatively exceed this limit within the month, you'll receive this quota exceeded error.

**Why This Query Exceeds the Quota:**

- **Large Dataset:** The `pm10_daily_summary` table contains a significant amount of data, especially when querying for an entire year (`'2020-01-01'` to `'2020-12-31'`) across the state of California.
- **Data Scanned:** Filtering on `state_name` and `date_local` still requires scanning all partitions (if the table isn't partitioned) or a large portion of the table, resulting in substantial data being processed.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Reduce the Date Range:**

   Narrowing the date range will decrease the amount of data scanned. For example, querying one month at a time:

   ```sql
   SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   You can loop through the months or quarters to collect the data in smaller chunks.

2. **Use Preview Options:**

   If you need to inspect the schema or preview the data:

   - **BigQuery Console Data Preview:** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the dataset and table. The console provides a preview of the first few rows without consuming your query quota.
   - **Table Metadata:** Review the table's metadata to understand its size and structure.

3. **Estimate Data Scanned Before Running Queries:**

   - Use the BigQuery query validator (dry run) to estimate the amount of data your query will process.
   - In the console, after writing your query, click on the "Query Validator" to see the estimated data scanned.

4. **Enable Billing for the Project:**

   - **Upgrade Quota:** By enabling billing, you can process data beyond the free tier limit.
   - **Set Budget Alerts:** Configure budget alerts to monitor and control your spending.
   - **Billing Considerations:** Be aware of the costs associated with querying large datasets. BigQuery charges $5 per TB of data processed.

5. **Optimize the Query:**

   - **Select Specific Columns:** You're already selecting specific columns, which helps reduce data scanned.
   - **Additional Filters:** If possible, add more filters (e.g., specific counties or sites) to reduce the dataset size.
   - **Check for Partitioning and Clustering:**
     - **Partitioning:** If the table is partitioned by `date_local`, ensure your query leverages partition pruning by filtering on the partitioned column.
     - **Clustering:** Clustering can improve query performance and reduce costs if you frequently filter by certain columns.

6. **Use Aggregated Tables or Summaries:**

   - Check if there's an existing aggregated or summary table that already contains monthly averages.
   - Alternatively, compute averages using smaller date ranges and combine the results.

**Next Steps:**

- **Try a Reduced Date Range:**

  ```sql
  SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
  WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

- **Monitor Data Processed:**

  - Before running the query, use the "Query Validator" to check the estimated data processed.
  - Ensure it falls within your remaining quota.

- **Consider Enabling Billing:**

  - If you need to process large amounts of data regularly, enabling billing is the most practical solution.
  - Remember to monitor your usage to avoid unexpected costs.

**Additional Information:**

- **Understanding BigQuery Costs and Quotas:**
  - [BigQuery Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing)
  - [BigQuery Quotas and Limits](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas)
  - [Managing Costs in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/managing-costs)

- **Best Practices for Cost Optimization:**
  - **Use Preview Features:** Preview data where possible without running full queries.
  - **Partition and Cluster Tables:** Design your datasets to optimize query performance and reduce costs.
  - **Cache Results:** If running the same query multiple times, consider caching results or materializing tables.

**Summary:**

The quota exceeded error occurs because your query scans more data than is allowed under the free tier quota. By reducing the amount of data processedâ€”either by narrowing the date range or adding more filtersâ€”you can attempt to run the query within your quota limits. For processing larger datasets, enabling billing will allow you to exceed the free tier, but be sure to monitor usage to manage costs effectively.

2025-01-20 14:10:04 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, you have a backtick (\`) instead of a closing single quote (') at the end of your date string `'2020-12-31`.

Here's the problematic line:

```sql
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31`
```

**Correction:**

Replace the backtick with a single quote at the end of `'2020-12-31'`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`

LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks in SQL:**
  - **Single Quotes ('...')** are used to enclose string literals, such as date strings or text.
  - **Backticks (\`...\`)** are used to enclose identifiers like column names or table names, especially if they contain special characters or match SQL reserved keywords.

- **Your Error:**
  - You started the date string with a single quote `'2020-12-31` but ended it with a backtick \`. This causes SQL to interpret the string literal as unclosed, leading to a syntax error.

- **Correct Usage:**
  - Ensure that you start and end string literals with the same quotation mark, usually single quotes in SQL.

---

**Additional Considerations:**

Given that you previously encountered quota exceeded errors, even after correcting the syntax, you might still face the same issue due to the amount of data being processed. Here's what you can do:

1. **Reduce the Date Range:**

   Try querying a smaller date range to decrease the amount of data scanned.

   **Example: Querying for January 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Estimate Data to Be Scanned:**

   Before running the query, use BigQuery's query validator to estimate how much data will be processed. This can help you verify whether the query will stay within your quota limits.

3. **Enable Billing:**

   If you need to process larger datasets, consider enabling billing for your project. This will allow you to exceed the free tier quota. Remember to set budget alerts to monitor and control costs.

---

**Summary:**

- **Fix the Syntax Error:** Replace the backtick with a single quote in your date string.
- **Be Mindful of Quotas:** The quota exceeded error is due to processing large amounts of data. Reduce the data scanned by narrowing the date range or enabling billing.

2025-01-20 14:10:53 - root - INFO - I see that you're encountering a "Quota exceeded" error when running your SQL query. Before addressing the quota issue, I'd like to point out a small syntax error in your query that needs to be corrected.

---

**Syntax Error Correction:**

In your `WHERE` clause, the end date `'2020-12-31` is missing a closing single quote and has a backtick (\`) instead. Here's the problematic line:

```sql
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31`
```

To fix the syntax error, replace the backtick with a single quote:

```sql
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

Even after correcting the syntax, you might still encounter the "Quota exceeded" error.

**Explanation of the Error:**

- **Error Message:** `403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.`
- **Meaning:** BigQuery has a free tier quota that allows you to process up to **1 TB of data per month**. If your queries collectively exceed this limit, you'll receive this error.

**Why This Query Exceeds the Quota:**

- **Large Dataset:** The table `pm25_frm_daily_summary` contains extensive data for PM2.5 measurements across the United States.
- **Date Range:** Querying an entire year's data (`2020-01-01` to `2020-12-31`) even for California can involve scanning a large amount of data.
- **Limit Clause:** The `LIMIT 1000` clause limits the number of rows returned but **does not** reduce the amount of data scanned during query execution.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Reduce the Amount of Data Scanned:**

   - **Query a Smaller Date Range:**

     Try querying data for a shorter period, such as a single month or day.

     *Example for January 2020:*

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
     WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   - **Add More Filters:**

     If possible, include additional filters like `county_name`, `city_name`, or specific `site_num` to narrow down the data.

   - **Use Sampling Techniques:**

     Retrieve a random sample of data to work with a smaller subset.

2. **Use Preview Features:**

   - **BigQuery Console Preview:**

     In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the dataset and table. Use the **Preview** tab to view sample data without consuming quota.

3. **Estimate Query Size Before Execution:**

   - **Query Validator:**

     Use BigQuery's **Query Validator** to estimate the amount of data your query will process. This helps ensure the query stays within your quota limits.

4. **Enable Billing for Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Quota:**

     If processing large datasets is essential, consider enabling billing. This allows you to exceed the free tier quota.

   - **Set Budget Alerts:**

     Configure budget alerts to monitor spending and avoid unexpected charges.

5. **Optimize Your Query:**

   - **Select Specific Columns:**

     Limit your query to only the columns you need. You're already doing this by selecting `date_local`.

   - **Partition Pruning:**

     If the table is partitioned by `date_local`, ensure your query leverages partition pruning by filtering on this column.

---

**Additional Information:**

- **BigQuery Free Tier Quota:**

  - **1 TB per Month:** Each project has a free data processing quota of 1 terabyte per month.
  - **Data Processed:** The quota is based on the amount of data scanned by your queries, not the number of rows returned.

- **Understanding Data Scanned:**

  - **Full Table Scan:** Even with filters, if the table isn't partitioned or clustered effectively, the query may scan a large portion of the table.
  - **LIMIT Clause:** Does not affect the amount of data scanned; it only limits the result set after scanning and processing the data.

---

**Recommendations:**

1. **Try a Reduced Date Range:**

   Focus on a shorter time period to minimize data scanned.

   *Example for a Single Day:*

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` = '2020-01-01'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Check Data Processing Estimate:**

   Before running the query, check the estimated data processed:

   - In the BigQuery console, after entering your query, click on **"Show Options"** and select **"Dry Run"** to see the estimated bytes processed.

3. **Enable Billing If Necessary:**

   If you need to analyze data that exceeds the free tier quota:

   - Enable billing for your project.
   - Set up cost controls and alerts.

4. **Use Alternative Datasets or Summaries:**

   - Look for aggregated datasets that might have the data pre-summarized.
   - Use public datasets that are smaller in size or specifically tailored for analysis.

---

**Example of Using a Smaller Dataset:**

If available, use an annual summary table which is much smaller:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM PARSE_DATE('%Y', CAST(year AS STRING))) AS month, AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS avg_pm25
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.air_quality_annual_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND parameter_name = 'PM2.5 FRM/FEM'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** This is just an illustrative example. Ensure that the `air_quality_annual_summary` table contains the required data at the monthly level.

---

**Conclusion:**

- The "Quota exceeded" error arises because your query scans more data than your project's quota allows.
- Reducing the amount of data scanned by narrowing your query or enabling billing are effective ways to resolve this issue.

---

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or have questions about modifying your queries to stay within quotas.
2025-01-20 14:11:35 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 14:11:35 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your queries, even after correcting the syntax and reducing the date range. This suggests that your project has reached the limit of its free query quota in BigQuery.

**Explanation:**

- **Free Query Quota:** Google BigQuery offers a free tier that allows up to **1 TB of data processing per month** per billing account.
- **Quota Consumption:** Once your project exceeds this quota, you'll receive the "Quota exceeded" error for any further queries within that billing cycle, regardless of their size.
- **Impact on Small Queries:** Even queries that process minimal data will be blocked once the quota is exhausted.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing for Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Quota:** By enabling billing, you can continue to run queries beyond the free tier limit.
   - **Cost Control:** BigQuery charges **$5 per terabyte** of data processed. You can set budgets and alerts to monitor and control spending.
   - **How to Enable Billing:**

     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
     - Navigate to **Billing** and connect a billing account to your project.

2. **Wait for the Quota Reset:**

   - **Monthly Quota Reset:** The free query quota resets at the beginning of each month.
   - **Alternative Option:** If you prefer not to enable billing, you can wait until the new billing cycle starts to resume querying.

3. **Check Your Current Quota Usage:**

   - **Review Quota Usage:**

     - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Quotas**.
     - Filter by **BigQuery API** to see your current usage and limits.

   - **Identify High Usage Queries:**

     - Review your recent queries to identify any that may have consumed large amounts of data.
     - Optimize those queries in the future to process less data.

4. **Optimize Your Queries Further:**

   - **Reduce Data Scanned:**

     - Limit your queries to smaller date ranges or specific locations within California.
     - Use additional filters to narrow down the dataset.

   - **Use Approximate Aggregations:**

     - Consider using approximate functions like `APPROX_QUANTILES` or `TOP` to reduce processing.

   - **Leverage Partitioning and Clustering:**

     - If the tables are partitioned by `date_local`, ensure your queries use partition pruning by filtering on this column.

5. **Use BigQuery Sandbox for Development:**

   - **Sandbox Limitations:**

     - The BigQuery sandbox allows you to use BigQuery without a billing account, but it has limitations.
     - It might not support large queries or certain operations.

6. **Alternative Approach:**

   - **Download and Process Data Locally:**

     - If possible, export a small subset of data to a local environment for analysis.
     - Note that data export may also be subject to quotas and limitations.

**Summary:**

The "Quota exceeded" error indicates that your project has used up its free query quota for the current month. To resolve this issue:

- **Enable Billing:** Consider enabling billing for your project to continue running queries. Be sure to monitor your usage to control costs.
- **Wait for Reset:** If you prefer not to enable billing, you'll need to wait until your quota resets at the beginning of the next month.
- **Optimize Queries:** In the future, optimize your queries to process less data and stay within the free tier limits.

2025-01-20 14:14:27 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your query:

---

**Input SQL:**

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error Information:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/troubleshoot-quotas
```

---

**Explanation:**

The error message indicates that your Google Cloud project has exceeded the free query data processing quota for BigQuery. The free tier allows up to **1 terabyte (TB)** of data processing per month for queries. Once this quota is exhausted, any further queries that process data will result in a quota exceeded error, even if the queries are small.

**Why This Is Happening:**

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data scanned during query execution, not the number of rows returned. The `LIMIT` clause reduces the number of rows in the result set but does not limit the amount of data scanned.
  
- **Large Dataset:** The table `pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary` contains extensive data. Querying for an entire year across the state of California involves scanning a significant amount of data, which contributes to exceeding your quota.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing for Your Project:**

   - **Description:** Enabling billing allows you to process more data by paying for the additional usage. BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte of data processed beyond the free tier, with the first 10 GB per month free.
   
   - **Steps to Enable Billing:**
     1. **Access Google Cloud Console:** Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
     2. **Navigate to Billing:** In the navigation menu, select **"Billing"**.
     3. **Link a Billing Account:** If you don't have a billing account, you'll need to create one and link it to your project.
     4. **Set Budgets and Alerts:** To control costs, set up budgets and alerts under the billing section to notify you when spending reaches certain thresholds.
   
   - **Considerations:** Enabling billing will incur costs based on your usage. Always monitor your spending to stay within your budget.

2. **Wait for the Quota to Reset:**

   - **Description:** The free query quota resets at the beginning of each month (Pacific Time).
   - **Actions:** If enabling billing isn't feasible, you can wait until your quota renews at the start of the next month.
   - **Considerations:** Plan your queries to optimize usage within the free tier limits in the future.

3. **Reduce the Amount of Data Scanned:**

   Since you've already exceeded your quota, this might not help immediately, but for future queries:

   - **Shorten the Date Range:**
     - Query data for shorter periods (e.g., one month or one day).
     - **Example:**
       ```sql
       SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
       WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` = '2020-01-01'
       LIMIT 1000;
       ```
   
   - **Filter Specific Locations or Parameters:**
     - Add more filters to narrow down the data (e.g., specific counties or sites).
   
   - **Use Approximate Query Techniques:**
     - While BigQuery doesn't support sampling in standard SQL, you can use other methods to limit data scanned. However, these may provide approximate results.

   **Note:** After exceeding the quota, even queries that scan minimal data will be blocked until the quota resets or billing is enabled.

**Recommendations:**

- **Enable Billing:** If you need immediate access to run queries and process data, enabling billing is the only solution. Be sure to monitor your usage to manage costs effectively.

- **Plan Future Queries:** To avoid hitting the quota limit in the future:
  - Monitor your data processing usage.
  - Optimize queries to scan less data.
  - Utilize partitioning and clustering if available.

**Assistance with Your Original Task:**

Understanding that you might not be able to run queries at the moment, I can help you by providing the SQL queries needed to calculate the monthly average levels of the pollutants you requested. You can run these queries when your quota resets or billing is enabled.

**SQL Queries to Calculate Monthly Averages:**

Below are the SQL queries to calculate the monthly average levels of each pollutant for California in 2020.

1. **PM10 Monthly Average:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
     FORMAT_DATE('%b', `date_local`) AS month,
     AVG(`arithmetic_mean`) AS pm10_avg
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE
     `state_name` = 'California' AND
     `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   GROUP BY
     month_num, month
   ORDER BY
     month_num;
   ```

2. **PM2.5 FRM Monthly Average:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
     FORMAT_DATE('%b', `date_local`) AS month,
     AVG(`arithmetic_mean`) AS pm25_frm_avg
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
   WHERE
     `state_name` = 'California' AND
     `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   GROUP BY
     month_num, month
   ORDER BY
     month_num;
   ```

3. **PM2.5 Non-FRM Monthly Average:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
     FORMAT_DATE('%b', `date_local`) AS month,
     AVG(`arithmetic_mean`) AS pm25_nonfrm_avg
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
   WHERE
     `state_name` = 'California' AND
     `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   GROUP BY
     month_num, month
   ORDER BY
     month_num;
   ```

4. **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Monthly Average:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
     FORMAT_DATE('%b', `date_local`) AS month,
     AVG(`arithmetic_mean`) AS voc_avg
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.voc_daily_summary`
   WHERE
     `state_name` = 'California' AND
     `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   GROUP BY
     month_num, month
   ORDER BY
     month_num;
   ```

5. **SOâ‚‚ Monthly Average (Scaled by 10):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
     FORMAT_DATE('%b', `date_local`) AS month,
     AVG(`arithmetic_mean` * 10) AS so2_scaled_avg
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.so2_daily_summary`
   WHERE
     `state_name` = 'California' AND
     `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   GROUP BY
     month_num, month
   ORDER BY
     month_num;
   ```

6. **Lead Monthly Average (Scaled by 100):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
     FORMAT_DATE('%b', `date_local`) AS month,
     AVG(`arithmetic_mean` * 100) AS lead_scaled_avg
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.lead_daily_summary`
   WHERE
     `state_name` = 'California' AND
     `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   GROUP BY
     month_num, month
   ORDER BY
     month_num;
   ```

**Combining All Results into a Single Query:**

You can combine these queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) or subqueries to get all the averages in a single result set.

**Example Combined Query:**

```sql
WITH
  pm10 AS (
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
      AVG(`arithmetic_mean`) AS pm10_avg
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
    WHERE
      `state_name` = 'California' AND
      `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
    GROUP BY
      month_num
  ),
  pm25_frm AS (
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
      AVG(`arithmetic_mean`) AS pm25_frm_avg
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
    WHERE
      `state_name` = 'California' AND
      `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
    GROUP BY
      month_num
  ),
  pm25_nonfrm AS (
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
      AVG(`arithmetic_mean`) AS pm25_nonfrm_avg
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
    WHERE
      `state_name` = 'California' AND
      `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
    GROUP BY
      month_num
  ),
  voc AS (
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
      AVG(`arithmetic_mean`) AS voc_avg
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.voc_daily_summary`
    WHERE
      `state_name` = 'California' AND
      `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
    GROUP BY
      month_num
  ),
  so2 AS (
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
      AVG(`arithmetic_mean` * 10) AS so2_scaled_avg
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.so2_daily_summary`
    WHERE
      `state_name` = 'California' AND
      `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
    GROUP BY
      month_num
  ),
  lead AS (
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
      AVG(`arithmetic_mean` * 100) AS lead_scaled_avg
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.lead_daily_summary`
    WHERE
      `state_name` = 'California' AND
      `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
    GROUP BY
      month_num
  )
SELECT
  pm10.month_num,
  FORMAT_DATE('%b', DATE(2020, pm10.month_num, 1)) AS month,
  pm10.pm10_avg,
  pm25_frm.pm25_frm_avg,
  pm25_nonfrm.pm25_nonfrm_avg,
  voc.voc_avg,
  so2.so2_scaled_avg,
  lead.lead_scaled_avg
FROM
  pm10
LEFT JOIN
  pm25_frm USING (month_num)
LEFT JOIN
  pm25_nonfrm USING (month_num)
LEFT JOIN
  voc USING (month_num)
LEFT JOIN
  so2 USING (month_num)
LEFT JOIN
  lead USING (month_num)
ORDER BY
  month_num;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Used to compute the monthly averages for each pollutant separately.
  
- **LEFT JOINs:** Combine the results based on `month_num` to ensure all months are included even if data for some pollutants is missing in certain months.

- **Formatting Month Names:**
  - `FORMAT_DATE('%b', DATE(2020, pm10.month_num, 1))` converts the month number to the abbreviated month name (e.g., "Jan", "Feb").

**Result:**

This query will generate a table with the monthly average levels of the specified pollutants for California in 2020. The results will be in the following format:

```csv
month_num,month,pm10_avg,pm25_frm_avg,pm25_nonfrm_avg,voc_avg,so2_scaled_avg,lead_scaled_avg
1,Jan,...,...,...,...,...,...
2,Feb,...,...,...,...,...,...
...
12,Dec,...,...,...,...,...,...
```

**Note:** Since you cannot run queries at the moment due to the quota limit, you can save these queries and execute them when your quota resets or after enabling billing.

**Final Thoughts:**

- **Monitoring Usage:** In the future, monitor your BigQuery usage to avoid exceeding the free tier limits.

- **Cost Management:** If you decide to enable billing, use BigQuery's cost control features to manage expenses effectively.

- **Further Assistance:** If you need help understanding the queries or have questions about modifying them for your needs, feel free to ask!

2025-01-20 14:15:05 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your query:

---

**Input SQL:**

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Information:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/troubleshoot-quotas
```

---

**Explanation:**

The "Quota exceeded" error indicates that your Google Cloud project has exhausted its free BigQuery query quota for the current billing cycle. BigQuery enforces quotas on the amount of data you can process for free each month. Once this quota is exceeded, any further queriesâ€”even ones that process minimal dataâ€”will result in this error until the quota resets or you enable billing.

**Why This Is Happening:**

- **Free Tier Quota Limit:** The BigQuery free tier allows up to **1 terabyte (TB)** of data processing per month per billing account.
- **Quota Exhaustion:** Once you've reached this limit, all subsequent queries will fail with the "Quota exceeded" error, regardless of their size.
- **LIMIT Clause:** Using `LIMIT` reduces the number of rows returned but **does not** reduce the amount of data scanned. BigQuery charges (and counts towards the quota) based on the data scanned during query execution.

**Options to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Wait for the Quota to Reset:**

   - **When It Resets:** The free query quota resets at the beginning of each month (Pacific Time).
   - **What You Can Do:** If you can postpone your work, you can wait until the new billing cycle starts to run your queries again without enabling billing.

2. **Enable Billing for Your Project:**

   - **How It Helps:** Enabling billing removes the free tier limitations, allowing you to process more data.
   - **Considerations:**
     - **Costs:** BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte of data processed beyond the free tier. Be mindful of potential costs.
     - **Budget Controls:**
       - **Set Budget Alerts:** Configure alerts to notify you when you reach certain spending thresholds.
       - **Monitor Usage:** Regularly check your usage to prevent unexpected charges.
   - **How to Enable Billing:**
     1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:** Navigate to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
     2. **Access Billing Section:** Select **"Billing"** from the main menu.
     3. **Link or Create a Billing Account:** If you don't have one, create a new billing account and link it to your project.
     4. **Set Up Cost Controls:** Use the **"Budgets & alerts"** feature to manage and monitor your expenses.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Optimize Future Queries:**
  - **Reduce Data Scanned:** Limit the amount of data your queries process by narrowing date ranges or adding more specific filters.
  - **Partitioned Tables:** Utilize partitioned tables to scan only relevant data.
  - **Preview Data:** Use the BigQuery console's preview feature to examine data without consuming quota.

- **Plan Your Workflows:**
  - **Schedule Intensive Queries Wisely:** If possible, schedule large data processing tasks early in the billing cycle when the quota resets.
  - **Monitor Quota Usage:** Keep an eye on your quota consumption to avoid unexpected interruptions.

**Assistance With Your Original Task:**

Since running queries isn't possible at the moment due to the quota issue, you might consider preparing your SQL queries for execution once your quota resets or billing is enabled. I've provided the queries necessary to calculate the monthly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, volatile organic compounds (VOC), SOâ‚‚ (scaled by a factor of 10), and Lead (scaled by a factor of 100) in California for the year 2020 in my previous response.

**Example Query for PM2.5 Non-FRM Monthly Averages:**

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month_num,
  FORMAT_DATE('%b', `date_local`) AS month,
  AVG(`arithmetic_mean`) AS pm25_nonfrm_avg
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
WHERE
  `state_name` = 'California' AND
  `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY
  month_num, month
ORDER BY
  month_num;
```

You can run this query when your quota resets or after enabling billing.

**Conclusion:**

At this point, to resolve the "Quota exceeded" error, you need to either:

- **Wait until the quota resets** at the beginning of the next month.
- **Enable billing** on your Google Cloud project to continue running queries now.

If you choose to enable billing, remember to set up budget alerts and monitor your usage to manage costs effectively. If you need assistance with setting up billing or have questions about the queries, feel free to ask. I'm here to help!
