2025-01-20 14:09:38 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing this issue. The error message indicates that your BigQuery query is exceeding the free query bytes quota. This happens because BigQuery charges based on the amount of data scanned, not the amount of data returned.

Even though you have a `LIMIT 1000` clause, BigQuery still needs to scan the entire table (or the relevant partitions) to process your query, which can lead to large amounts of data being scanned, especially with large tables like the EPA historical air quality datasets.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Reduce the Amount of Data Scanned:**

   - **Partition Pruning:** If the table is partitioned on `date_local`, you can use a date range in your `WHERE` clause to ensure that only the necessary partitions are scanned. For example:

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
     WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
       AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     This can help BigQuery limit the scanned data to only the partitions corresponding to the dates specified.

2. **Use Preview or Sample Data:**

   - Instead of running a query, you can use the BigQuery UI to preview the table data, which doesn't count against your quota.

3. **Estimate with Smaller Datasets:**

   - If possible, try running the query on a smaller dataset or for a shorter time range to stay within the quota.

4. **Check Table Size:**

   - The `pm10_daily_summary` table may be quite large. You can check the size of the table and see how much data your query would scan before running it. In the BigQuery UI, you can see an estimate of the number of bytes your query will process.

5. **Use Caching:**

   - If you've run the query before, BigQuery caches the results for 24 hours. Rerunning the same query within this period might not incur additional costs.

6. **Upgrade Your Quota:**

   - If possible, consider upgrading your BigQuery quota or setting up billing to allow for larger queries.

**Alternative Approach:**

Since running exploratory queries might not be feasible due to quota limitations, you can proceed to write the final SQL query needed to calculate the monthly averages for the pollutants specified.

**Final SQL Query:**

```sql
WITH pm10 AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
           AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm10_avg
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
    WHERE state_name = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020
    GROUP BY month
),
pm25_frm AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
           AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm25_frm_avg
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
    WHERE state_name = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020
    GROUP BY month
),
pm25_nonfrm AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
           AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm25_nonfrm_avg
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
    WHERE state_name = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020
    GROUP BY month
),
voc AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
           AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS voc_avg
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.voc_daily_summary`
    WHERE state_name = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020
    GROUP BY month
),
so2 AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
           AVG(arithmetic_mean) * 10 AS so2_scaled_avg
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.so2_daily_summary`
    WHERE state_name = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020
    GROUP BY month
),
lead AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
           AVG(arithmetic_mean) * 100 AS lead_scaled_avg
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.lead_daily_summary`
    WHERE state_name = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020
    GROUP BY month
)
SELECT COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month, lead.month) AS Month_num,
       pm10.pm10_avg,
       pm25_frm.pm25_frm_avg,
       pm25_nonfrm.pm25_nonfrm_avg,
       voc.voc_avg,
       so2.so2_scaled_avg,
       lead.lead_scaled_avg
FROM pm10
FULL OUTER JOIN pm25_frm ON pm10.month = pm25_frm.month
FULL OUTER JOIN pm25_nonfrm ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month) = pm25_nonfrm.month
FULL OUTER JOIN voc ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month) = voc.month
FULL OUTER JOIN so2 ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month) = so2.month
FULL OUTER JOIN lead ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month) = lead.month
ORDER BY Month_num;
```

This query calculates the monthly average levels for each pollutant and scales SO₂ and Lead accordingly. The `COALESCE` function ensures that all months with data are included even if some pollutants don't have data for a specific month.

**Note:** Running this query may still exceed your free quota due to the size of the datasets involved.

**Suggestions:**

- **Run Individual Queries:** To reduce the data scanned at one time, run separate queries for each pollutant. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm10_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month;
  ```

- **Use Subsampling (Approximate Results):** While not ideal for precise calculations, you can sample a portion of the data to reduce the amount of data scanned.

  ```sql
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm10_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California'
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CONCAT(CAST(date_local AS STRING), site_num))), 10) = 0
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month;
  ```

  **Note:** This query samples approximately 10% of the data by using a hash function. Adjust the modulus to change the sample size.

- **Upgrade Quota:** If feasible, consider setting up billing in your Google Cloud project to increase your query quota.

**Summary:**

- The error occurs because the query scans a large amount of data, exceeding your free quota.
- Adjusting your queries to scan less data or upgrading your quota are potential solutions.
- Running smaller queries for individual pollutants may help stay within the quota limits.

**Additional Assistance:**

If you're unable to run the queries due to quota limitations, and upgrading the quota isn't an option, please let me know, and I can assist by providing the expected output format or guide you through interpreting the data based on available documentation.

**Expected Output Format:**

As per your initial request, here's the expected CSV format:

```csv
Month_num,Month,PM10_avg,PM25_FRM_avg,PM25_nonFRM_avg,VOC_avg,SO2_scaled_avg,Lead_scaled_avg
1,Jan,pm10_avg1:float,pm25_frm_avg1:float,pm25_nonfrm_avg1:float,voc_avg1:float,so2_scaled_avg1:float,lead_scaled_avg1:float
2,Feb,pm10_avg2:float,pm25_frm_avg2:float,pm25_nonfrm_avg2:float,voc_avg2:float,so2_scaled_avg2:float,lead_scaled_avg2:float

2025-01-20 14:10:27 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 14:10:27 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the same issue. The error message indicates that your BigQuery project has exceeded the quota for free query bytes scanned. This means that the queries you're attempting require scanning more data than your current quota allows.

**Understanding the Issue:**

- **Quota Limitations:** BigQuery enforces quotas to prevent excessive use of resources. These quotas include limitations on the amount of data you can query for free.
- **Data Size:** The EPA historical air quality tables are quite large. Even simple queries can scan gigabytes of data because BigQuery processes entire columns when executing queries, unless the data is partitioned or clustered optimally.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Reduce Data Scanned:** Modify your queries to scan less data.

   - **Date Filtering with Partitioning:**

     If the `date_local` column is used for partitioning in the table, filtering on this column can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
     WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
       AND `date_local` >= '2020-01-01' AND `date_local` < '2021-01-01'
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   - **Preview Data:**

     Use the table preview option in the BigQuery UI to see a snapshot of the data without incurring query costs.

2. **Use Aggregated Tables or Views:**

   Sometimes, datasets include pre-aggregated data which is smaller in size.

3. **Sample the Data:**

   Retrieve a random sample instead of processing the entire dataset.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
     AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Note:** The `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` clause is not supported in BigQuery, so you might need to emulate sampling by filtering on a hashed value.

4. **Estimate Query Size Before Running:**

   - In the BigQuery UI, you can see an estimate of the amount of data your query will scan before running it. This can help you adjust your query accordingly.

5. **Upgrade Quota:**

   - If possible, consider setting up billing for your Google Cloud project. This will increase your query quotas and allow you to process larger amounts of data.

6. **Export Data for Local Analysis:**

   - **Download Data:**

     If the dataset provider allows, you might be able to download the data files (e.g., CSV) and perform the analysis locally using tools like Python, R, or even Excel.

   - **Use APIs:**

     The EPA might provide APIs to access their data in smaller chunks.

**Alternative Approach:**

Since you're unable to execute queries due to quota limitations, I can help you understand how to structure the analysis or provide guidance on expected results based on available information.

**Expected Output Structure:**

```csv
Month_num,Month,PM10_avg,PM25_FRM_avg,PM25_nonFRM_avg,VOC_avg,SO2_scaled_avg,Lead_scaled_avg
1,Jan,pm10_avg1:float,pm25_frm_avg1:float,pm25_nonfrm_avg1:float,voc_avg1:float,so2_scaled_avg1:float,lead_scaled_avg1:float
2,Feb,pm10_avg2:float,pm25_frm_avg2:float,pm25_nonfrm_avg2:float,voc_avg2:float,so2_scaled_avg2:float,lead_scaled_avg2:float
...
12,Dec,pm10_avg12:float,pm25_frm_avg12:float,pm25_nonfrm_avg12:float,voc_avg12:float,so2_scaled_avg12:float,lead_scaled_avg12:float
```

This table represents:

- **Month_num:** Numeric representation of the month (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).
- **Month:** Abbreviated month name.
- **PM10_avg:** Average PM10 levels for the month.
- **PM25_FRM_avg:** Average PM2.5 FRM levels for the month.
- **PM25_nonFRM_avg:** Average PM2.5 non-FRM levels for the month.
- **VOC_avg:** Average volatile organic compounds levels for the month.
- **SO2_scaled_avg:** Average SO₂ levels for the month, scaled by a factor of 10.
- **Lead_scaled_avg:** Average Lead levels for the month, scaled by a factor of 100.

**Assistance Without Running Queries:**

While I don't have the ability to run the queries or access the real-time data directly, I can help you with the following:

- **Explain How to Compute Averages:**

  - For each pollutant, group the data by month and calculate the average of the `arithmetic_mean` column.
  - Apply the scaling factors to SO₂ and Lead as specified.

- **Guide on Data Processing:**

  - If you manage to obtain a subset of the data, I can guide you through processing it using programming languages like Python (with pandas) or R.

- **Sample Code for Local Analysis:**

  - **Python Example:**

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Load the data into a DataFrame
    pm10_df = pd.read_csv('pm10_daily_summary.csv')

    # Filter for California and Year 2020
    pm10_df['date_local'] = pd.to_datetime(pm10_df['date_local'])
    pm10_2020_ca = pm10_df[
        (pm10_df['state_name'] == 'California') &
        (pm10_df['date_local'].dt.year == 2020)
    ]

    # Extract Month and Compute Average
    pm10_2020_ca['month'] = pm10_2020_ca['date_local'].dt.month
    pm10_monthly_avg = pm10_2020_ca.groupby('month')['arithmetic_mean'].mean().reset_index()
    ```

  - Repeat similar steps for other pollutants.

**Next Steps:**

- **Check for Data Availability:**

  - Verify if the EPA provides data downloads or APIs that you can use without BigQuery.

- **Consider Alternative Platforms:**

  - Platforms like Kaggle sometimes host public datasets with fewer restrictions.

- **Collaborate with Others:**

  - If you're part of an organization or educational institution, check if they have resources or subscriptions that can help you access and process the data.

**Summary:**

- The error persists because the queries exceed the free quota limits.
- Without adjusting the queries to reduce data scanned or increasing your quota, running them isn't feasible.
- Alternative approaches include downloading the data for local analysis or using different tools/platforms.
- I'm here to assist you in any way possible within these constraints.

2025-01-20 14:11:38 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 14:11:38 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still experiencing the quota exceeded error when running your query in BigQuery. This happens because, even though your query seems simple, it requires scanning a large amount of data due to the size of the `pm10_daily_summary` table.

BigQuery charges based on the amount of data scanned during query execution, not the amount of data returned. Even with a `LIMIT` clause, operations like `SELECT DISTINCT` and `EXTRACT` on large tables can cause the query to exceed your free query quota because BigQuery needs to scan the entire table (or relevant partitions) to process these functions.

**Why the Query Exceeds Quota:**

- **Full Table Scan:** The use of `SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local)` forces BigQuery to scan all rows in the table to find all distinct months.
- **Large Dataset:** The `pm10_daily_summary` table contains a significant amount of data collected over many years and locations.

**Strategies to Reduce Data Scanned:**

1. **Filter by Date Range Using Partitioning:**

   If the table is partitioned on `date_local`, filtering directly on this column can significantly reduce the data scanned. Instead of using `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020`, specify the exact date range:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE state_name = 'California'
     AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Note:** Using `BETWEEN` or direct date comparisons allows BigQuery to perform partition pruning if the table is date-partitioned, scanning only the data for the specified date range.

2. **Limit to a Smaller Date Range:**

   To test the query and reduce data scanned, limit the query to a single month or a few days:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE state_name = 'California'
     AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   This reduces the data scanned to just January 2020.

3. **Use Approximate Methods (Sampling):**

   While BigQuery doesn't support table sampling directly in standard SQL, you can approximate sampling by using a hash function:

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE state_name = 'California'
     AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020
     AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CONCAT(CAST(date_local AS STRING), site_num))), 100) = 1
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   This selects approximately 1% of the data.

4. **Check if Data Required is Small Enough:**

   Since the purpose is to calculate monthly averages, and months in a year are known, you might not need to run a query to list the months.

**Proceeding Without Exceeding Quota:**

Given the limitations, you might consider proceeding directly to writing the final query to calculate the monthly averages, keeping in mind that running it may still exceed the quota. However, I'll provide the final query structure that you can use when you have the necessary resources:

**Final SQL Query to Calculate Monthly Averages:**

```sql
-- Calculate PM10 Monthly Averages
WITH pm10 AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm10_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),

-- Calculate PM2.5 FRM Monthly Averages
pm25_frm AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm25_frm_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),

-- Calculate PM2.5 Non-FRM Monthly Averages
pm25_nonfrm AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm25_nonfrm_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),

-- Calculate VOC Monthly Averages
voc AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS voc_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.voc_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),

-- Calculate SO2 Monthly Averages (Scaled by 10)
so2 AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) * 10 AS so2_scaled_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.so2_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),

-- Calculate Lead Monthly Averages (Scaled by 100)
lead AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) * 100 AS lead_scaled_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.lead_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
)

-- Combine All Averages
SELECT 
  COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month, lead.month) AS Month_num,
  CASE WHEN COALESCE(pm10.month) IS NOT NULL THEN FORMAT_DATE('%b', DATE_PARSE(STRING(pm10.month), '%m')) END AS Month,
  pm10.pm10_avg,
  pm25_frm.pm25_frm_avg,
  pm25_nonfrm.pm25_nonfrm_avg,
  voc.voc_avg,
  so2.so2_scaled_avg,
  lead.lead_scaled_avg
FROM pm10
FULL OUTER JOIN pm25_frm ON pm10.month = pm25_frm.month
FULL OUTER JOIN pm25_nonfrm ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month) = pm25_nonfrm.month
FULL OUTER JOIN voc ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month) = voc.month
FULL OUTER JOIN so2 ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month) = so2.month
FULL OUTER JOIN lead ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month) = lead.month
ORDER BY Month_num;
```

**Explanation:**

- Each Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the monthly average for one pollutant.
- The date range filters are specified using `date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'` to leverage partition pruning.
- The scaling factors for SO₂ and Lead are applied within the `AVG` calculation.
- A full outer join combines all monthly averages, ensuring no data is lost for months where some pollutants may not have data.
- `COALESCE` is used to align months from different CTEs.
- `FORMAT_DATE('%b', ...)` converts the month number to an abbreviated month name (e.g., 1 to 'Jan').

**Note:**

- Running this query may still exceed your free quota due to the size of the datasets.
- If you cannot run this query, consider processing the data in smaller chunks or upgrading your quota by enabling billing in your Google Cloud project.

**Alternative Approaches:**

1. **Process Data in Smaller Chunks:**

   Divide your queries to process one pollutant at a time and limit to a smaller date range.

   ```sql
   -- Calculate PM10 Average for January 2020
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
          AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm10_avg
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
   GROUP BY month;
   ```

2. **Export Data for Local Processing:**

   If possible, export the relevant data to a local file for processing using tools like Python or R. Be aware that exporting large datasets may also be subject to quota limits.

3. **Use a Different Dataset or Tool:**

   Find if there are smaller, more manageable datasets available that contain the required information, or use EPA's APIs to retrieve data without exceeding quotas.

**Expected Output Format:**

Given the constraints, here's the output format you can expect from the final query:

```csv
Month_num,Month,PM10_avg,PM25_FRM_avg,PM25_nonFRM_avg,VOC_avg,SO2_scaled_avg,Lead_scaled_avg
1,Jan,pm10_avg1:float,pm25_frm_avg1:float,pm25_nonfrm_avg1:float,voc_avg1:float,so2_scaled_avg1:float,lead_scaled_avg1:float
2,Feb,pm10_avg2:float,pm25_frm_avg2:float,pm25_nonfrm_avg2:float,voc_avg2:float,so2_scaled_avg2:float,lead_scaled_avg2:float
...
12,Dec,pm10_avg12:float,pm25_frm_avg12:float,pm25_nonfrm_avg12:float,voc_avg12:float,so2_scaled_avg12:float,lead_scaled_avg12:float
```

**Next Steps:**

- **Try Running Smaller Queries:** Attempt to run individual queries for each pollutant for a single month to see if they execute without exceeding the quota.
- **Consider Setting Up Billing:** Enabling billing allows for a larger query quota, and the first 10 TB of queries each month are free under the Google Cloud free tier.

2025-01-20 14:12:26 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering errors when running your SQL queries. Let's address each error one at a time, identify the root cause, and provide corrected versions of the queries.

---

### **Error 1: Function not found: `DATE_PARSE`**

**Original SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Combine All Averages
SELECT 
  COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month, lead.month) AS Month_num,
  CASE WHEN COALESCE(pm10.month) IS NOT NULL THEN FORMAT_DATE('%b', DATE_PARSE(STRING(pm10.month), '%m')) END AS Month,
  pm10.pm10_avg,
  pm25_frm.pm25_frm_avg,
  pm25_nonfrm.pm25_nonfrm_avg,
  voc.voc_avg,
  so2.so2_scaled_avg,
  lead.lead_scaled_avg
FROM pm10
-- (Rest of the query)
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Function not found: DATE_PARSE at [58:69]; reason: invalidQuery
```

**Cause:**

- The function `DATE_PARSE` is **not available** in BigQuery.
- In BigQuery SQL, the correct function to parse a date from a string is `PARSE_DATE`.

**Solution:**

Modify the query to use `PARSE_DATE` instead of `DATE_PARSE`. However, since you're converting a month number to a month name, there's a simpler approach.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Combine All Averages
SELECT 
  COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month, lead.month) AS Month_num,
  CASE
    WHEN COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month, lead.month) IS NOT NULL THEN
      FORMAT_DATE('%b', DATE(2020, COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month, lead.month), 1))
  END AS Month,
  pm10.pm10_avg,
  pm25_frm.pm25_frm_avg,
  pm25_nonfrm.pm25_nonfrm_avg,
  voc.voc_avg,
  so2.so2_scaled_avg,
  lead.lead_scaled_avg
FROM pm10
FULL OUTER JOIN pm25_frm ON pm10.month = pm25_frm.month
FULL OUTER JOIN pm25_nonfrm ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month) = pm25_nonfrm.month
FULL OUTER JOIN voc ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month) = voc.month
FULL OUTER JOIN so2 ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month) = so2.month
FULL OUTER JOIN lead ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month) = lead.month
ORDER BY Month_num;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Using `DATE` Function:**
  - `DATE(year, month, day)` creates a date from integer values.
  - We know the year is `2020`, and the month is the month number from the data.
- **Formatting the Month Name:**
  - `FORMAT_DATE('%b', DATE(2020, month_number, 1))` returns the abbreviated month name (e.g., 'Jan', 'Feb').
- **Using `COALESCE` in the CASE Statement:**
  - Ensure that we have a month value to work with by using `COALESCE` on all possible month columns.

---

### **Error 2: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal**

**Original SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California`
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:25]; reason: invalidQuery
```

**Cause:**

- There's a missing closing single quote `'` in the condition `WHERE state_name = 'California\``.
- The string literal `'California` is not properly closed.

**Solution:**

Correct the syntax by adding the missing single quote.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **Additional Suggestions**

1. **Consistent Quotation Marks:**

   - In SQL, use backticks `` ` `` to enclose identifiers (e.g., table names, column names) if needed.
   - Use single quotes `' '` to enclose string literals.
   - Ensure that every opening quote has a corresponding closing quote.

2. **Simplify Month Number Conversion:**

   - Since you know the month number, you can create a mapping without parsing dates.
   - Alternatively, use an array or CASE statement to map month numbers to month names.

3. **Alternative Month Name Conversion Using `MONTHNAME` Function:**

   - BigQuery does not have a built-in `MONTHNAME` function, but you can use `FORMAT_DATE`.
   - Example:

     ```sql
     FORMAT_DATE('%B', DATE(2020, month_number, 1)) AS Month_Full_Name,
     FORMAT_DATE('%b', DATE(2020, month_number, 1)) AS Month_Abbr
     ```

---

### **Final Corrected Query**

Putting it all together, here's the corrected and optimized final query:

```sql
WITH pm10 AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm10_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),
pm25_frm AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm25_frm_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),
pm25_nonfrm AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm25_nonfrm_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),
voc AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS voc_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.voc_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),
so2 AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) * 10 AS so2_scaled_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.so2_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
),
lead AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
         AVG(arithmetic_mean) * 100 AS lead_scaled_avg
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.lead_daily_summary`
  WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  GROUP BY month
)

SELECT 
  COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month, lead.month) AS Month_num,
  FORMAT_DATE('%b', DATE(2020, COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month, lead.month), 1)) AS Month,
  pm10.pm10_avg,
  pm25_frm.pm25_frm_avg,
  pm25_nonfrm.pm25_nonfrm_avg,
  voc.voc_avg,
  so2.so2_scaled_avg,
  lead.lead_scaled_avg
FROM pm10
FULL OUTER JOIN pm25_frm ON pm10.month = pm25_frm.month
FULL OUTER JOIN pm25_nonfrm ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month) = pm25_nonfrm.month
FULL OUTER JOIN voc ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month) = voc.month
FULL OUTER JOIN so2 ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month) = so2.month
FULL OUTER JOIN lead ON COALESCE(pm10.month, pm25_frm.month, pm25_nonfrm.month, voc.month, so2.month) = lead.month
ORDER BY Month_num;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- Replaced `DATE_PARSE` with `DATE` function.
- Used `FORMAT_DATE` to get the abbreviated month name.
- Applied `COALESCE` function consistently to ensure we have a valid month number.

### **Testing the Query**

Before running the full query, you can test it with a smaller dataset to ensure it works and to stay within your quota limits:

```sql
-- Test with a single pollutant and one month
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local) AS month,
       FORMAT_DATE('%b', DATE(2020, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_local), 1)) AS Month,
       AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS pm10_avg
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE state_name = 'California' AND date_local BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

This will calculate the average PM10 levels for January 2020 in California.

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Quota Limitations:**

  - If you continue to experience quota issues, consider running queries for individual pollutants one at a time or for smaller date ranges to reduce the amount of data processed.
  - You may also consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud account to increase your quota (note that the first 10 TB per month are free).

- **Checking for Nulls:**

  - When using `COALESCE`, ensure that at least one of the month columns contains a value.
  - If all month columns are `NULL` for a particular record, the `COALESCE` function will return `NULL`, and you may need to handle that case if it arises.

---

### **Summary**

- **Error Corrections:**

  - Replaced `DATE_PARSE` with `DATE` and `FORMAT_DATE` functions.
  - Fixed unclosed string literal by closing the single quote.
  
- **Recommended Practices:**

  - Always verify that functions used are supported in the SQL dialect you're working with (BigQuery SQL in this case).
  - Ensure all string literals and identifiers are properly closed.
  - Test queries with smaller datasets to validate syntax and logic before running on the full dataset.

2025-01-20 14:13:14 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still experiencing issues with the BigQuery quota when running your queries. The error message indicates:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Understanding the Issue:**

Even though your query includes a `LIMIT 1000`, BigQuery charges based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned. Operations like `EXTRACT` and filtering with `WHERE` clauses may not reduce the amount of data scanned significantly because BigQuery might need to read the entire table or all partitions that match the date range.

In your query:

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

Even though you're filtering for California in January 2020, if the `pm10_daily_summary` table is not partitioned by `date_local`, or if the partitioning is not optimized, BigQuery might still scan a large portion of the table.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Check Table Partitioning:**

   - **Partitioned Tables:** If the table is partitioned by `date_local`, you can leverage partition pruning by using literal date ranges:

     ```sql
     SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
     WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
       AND `date_local` >= '2020-01-01' AND `date_local` < '2020-02-01'
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     This method can reduce the amount of data scanned by restricting the query to the specific date partitions.

2. **Use Clustering Columns:**

   - If the table is clustered on `state_name` and `date_local`, BigQuery can more efficiently scan only the relevant data.

3. **Reduce the Date Range Further:**

   - Try limiting your query to a single day or a smaller range:

     ```sql
     SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
     WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
       AND `date_local` = '2020-01-01'
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     This significantly reduces the data scanned.

4. **Estimate Query Size Before Running:**

   - In the BigQuery UI, you can see an estimate of the bytes scanned before running the query. This can help you adjust the query to stay within quota limits.

5. **Enable Billing for Increased Quota:**

   - Setting up billing on your Google Cloud project increases your quota. The first 10 TB of query data processed each month is free under the [BigQuery sandbox limitations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox).

6. **Use Public Datasets in Alternative Formats:**

   - **Download Data Locally:**

     - The EPA provides air quality data through their website, which can be downloaded in CSV format for local analysis: [EPA Air Quality System (AQS) Data](https://www.epa.gov/aqs).

   - **Use API Access:**

     - The EPA's AirData API allows for programmatic access to air quality data: [AirData API](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/api).

**Alternative Approach Without Running Queries:**

Given the quota limitations, you might not be able to run the queries in BigQuery. However, I can help you understand how to proceed with the analysis using alternative methods.

**Steps to Perform Analysis Locally:**

1. **Download the Data:**

   - Visit the [EPA's AirData website](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data) to download the necessary datasets for PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, VOCs, SO₂, and Lead for California in 2020.

2. **Load the Data into a Tool:**

   - Use data analysis tools like **Microsoft Excel**, **Python (pandas)**, **R**, or **SQL databases** to load and process the data.

3. **Calculate Monthly Averages:**

   - **Using Python (pandas):**

     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Load the CSV files
     pm10_df = pd.read_csv('pm10_2020_ca.csv')
     pm10_df['date_local'] = pd.to_datetime(pm10_df['date_local'])

     # Filter for California and 2020 data (if not already filtered)
     pm10_df = pm10_df[pm10_df['state_name'] == 'California']

     # Extract the month
     pm10_df['month'] = pm10_df['date_local'].dt.month

     # Calculate monthly average
     pm10_monthly_avg = pm10_df.groupby('month')['arithmetic_mean'].mean().reset_index()
     pm10_monthly_avg.rename(columns={'arithmetic_mean': 'pm10_avg'}, inplace=True)
     ```

     - Repeat similar steps for PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, VOCs, SO₂, and Lead.
     - Apply scaling factors to SO₂ (`*10`) and Lead (`*100`).

4. **Merge the Dataframes:**

   - Merge all the monthly average dataframes on the `month` column to get a consolidated table.

     ```python
     # Merge dataframes
     final_df = pm10_monthly_avg.merge(pm25_frm_monthly_avg, on='month', how='outer')
     final_df = final_df.merge(pm25_nonfrm_monthly_avg, on='month', how='outer')
     final_df = final_df.merge(voc_monthly_avg, on='month', how='outer')
     final_df = final_df.merge(so2_monthly_avg, on='month', how='outer')
     final_df = final_df.merge(lead_monthly_avg, on='month', how='outer')
     ```

5. **Add Month Names:**

   - Add a column for the abbreviated month name.

     ```python
     final_df['Month'] = final_df['month'].apply(lambda x: pd.Timestamp(2020, x, 1).strftime('%b'))
     ```

6. **Reorder Columns and Save the Result:**

   - Arrange the columns in the desired order and save the result to a CSV file.

     ```python
     final_df = final_df[['month', 'Month', 'pm10_avg', 'pm25_frm_avg', 'pm25_nonfrm_avg', 'voc_avg', 'so2_scaled_avg', 'lead_scaled_avg']]
     final_df.to_csv('monthly_pollutant_averages_2020_ca.csv', index=False)
     ```

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Month_num,Month,PM10_avg,PM25_FRM_avg,PM25_nonFRM_avg,VOC_avg,SO2_scaled_avg,Lead_scaled_avg
1,Jan,pm10_avg1,pm25_frm_avg1,pm25_nonfrm_avg1,voc_avg1,so2_scaled_avg1,lead_scaled_avg1
2,Feb,pm10_avg2,pm25_frm_avg2,pm25_nonfrm_avg2,voc_avg2,so2_scaled_avg2,lead_scaled_avg2
...
12,Dec,pm10_avg12,pm25_frm_avg12,pm25_nonfrm_avg12,voc_avg12,so2_scaled_avg12,lead_scaled_avg12
```

**Assistance With Data Processing:**

- **Data Availability:**

  - If you have difficulty accessing the data, I can guide you to resources where you can obtain the datasets required for your analysis.

- **Processing Guidance:**

  - I can provide sample code, formulas, or further assistance in setting up your local environment to perform the analysis.

**Summary:**

- **Quota Limitations in BigQuery:**

  - The error is due to exceeding the free tier quota for data scanned. Queries scan large amounts of data even with filters and limits.

- **Alternative Solutions:**

  - Narrowing down the date range may not sufficiently reduce data scanned.
  - Enabling billing can increase your quota, but it might not be feasible for all users.

- **Recommended Approach:**

  - **Download and analyze the data locally** using data provided by the EPA.
  - Use tools like Python, R, or Excel to perform the analysis.

- **Offer Further Assistance:**

  - I'm here to help you with any steps in the data acquisition and analysis process.

2025-01-20 14:14:11 - root - INFO - **Identifying the Issues:**

1. **Syntax Error in the Query:**

   In the SQL query you've provided, there is a syntax error:

   ```sql
   SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California`
     AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
     AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) = 1
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Issue:**

   - The string literal `'California` has an opening single quote `'` but is closed with a backtick ``` ` ``` instead of another single quote.
   - The condition `state_name` = 'California\` should be `state_name` = 'California'.

2. **Quota Exceeded Error:**

   Despite the syntax error, the error message you're receiving is:

   ```
   403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
   ```

   This suggests that BigQuery is interpreting the query and attempting to run it, but is unable to proceed due to the data size exceeding your project's query quota.

**Possible Explanations:**

- **BigQuery May Be Correcting Minor Syntax Errors Automatically:**

  In some cases, BigQuery might attempt to parse and correct minor syntax issues, or the error message might be from a previous query without syntax errors.

- **Mismatch Between Query and Error Message:**

  It's possible that the query which generated the error is slightly different from the one you've provided, and the error corresponds to a query without syntax errors.

**Steps to Resolve the Issues:**

1. **Fix the Syntax Error:**

   Correct the syntax error by ensuring that all string literals are properly enclosed with single quotes `'`.

   **Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
     AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
     AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) = 1
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Reduce the Amount of Data Scanned:**

   Even with the corrected query, you're encountering a quota exceeded error due to the amount of data being scanned. To reduce the data scanned:

   - **Use Partition Pruning with Date Range Filters:**

     If the table `pm10_daily_summary` is partitioned by `date_local`, you can filter using exact date ranges to limit the partitions scanned.

     ```sql
     SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
     WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
       AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-01'
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     This restricts the query to data from a single day, significantly reducing the data scanned.

   - **Add Additional Filters:**

     If possible, add more filters to narrow down the data, such as specific `county_name` or `site_num`.

   - **Estimate Bytes to Be Processed:**

     Before running the query, you can check the estimated bytes to be processed in the BigQuery editor. This helps to ensure your query stays within the quota.

3. **Consider Enabling Billing to Increase Quota:**

   If feasible, enable billing for your Google Cloud project. The free tier allows for 10 GB of free storage and 1 TB of free query processing per month. This can help avoid quota limitations.

4. **Use Public Datasets with Smaller Sizes or Pre-Aggregated Data:**

   If available, you can use summarized or smaller datasets that cover only the necessary data.

5. **Download the Data for Local Processing:**

   - **Obtain Data from EPA Websites:**

     Visit the [EPA's AirData website](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data) to download the PM10 data for California in 2020.

   - **Process the Data Locally:**

     Use tools like **Python**, **R**, or **Excel** to process the data and calculate the averages you need.

   - **Sample Code in Python (pandas):**

     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Load data from CSV file
     data = pd.read_csv('pm10_daily_summary_california_2020.csv')

     # Convert 'date_local' to datetime
     data['date_local'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date_local'])

     # Filter data for January 2020
     january_data = data[
         (data['date_local'] >= '2020-01-01') & (data['date_local'] <= '2020-01-31')
     ]

     # Calculate average pm10_level
     pm10_average = january_data['arithmetic_mean'].mean()
     print(f"Average PM10 Level in California for January 2020: {pm10_average}")
     ```

**Conclusion:**

- **Syntax Error Correction:**

  Ensure that all string literals are properly enclosed with single quotes to prevent syntax errors.

- **Quota Management:**

  By reducing the date range and adding more filters, you can decrease the amount of data scanned to stay within the free quota.

- **Alternative Data Processing:**

  If BigQuery's quota limitations prevent you from running the query, processing the data locally is a viable alternative.

### **Issue 1: Syntax Error in SQL Query**

**Original SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California`
     AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
     AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) = 1
   LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:25]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:25]
```

**Cause of the Error:**

- The syntax error is due to an unclosed string literal in your `WHERE` clause.
- In the condition `state_name` = 'California\`:
  - The string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a backtick ``` ` ```, which is incorrect.
  - SQL string literals must begin and end with the same type of quotation mark, typically single quotes `'`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean` AS pm10_level
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **String Literal Correction:**
  - Ensure that both the opening and closing quotation marks for string literals are single quotes `'`.
  - Change `'California\`` to `'California'`.

- **Usage of Backticks:**
  - Backticks ``` ` ``` are used in SQL to enclose identifiers (e.g., table names, column names) that might collide with reserved keywords or contain special characters.
  - Do not use backticks to enclose string literals.

### **Issue 2: Quota Exceeded in BigQuery**

**Original SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `site_num`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Cause of the Error:**

- **Data Scanned Exceeds Free Quota:**
  - BigQuery enforces quotas based on the amount of data scanned during a query, not the amount of data returned.
  - Even with a `LIMIT 1000` clause, BigQuery must scan all relevant data to process the query, especially when using `SELECT DISTINCT`, which requires examining all matching rows to find unique values.
  - The `pm25_frm_daily_summary` table is large, and filtering on `state_name` and `date_local` for the entire year of 2020 may still exceed the free query quota.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Reduce the Amount of Data Scanned:**

   - **Filter Date Range Using Partitioning:**

     - **Check if the Table is Partitioned:**
       - If `date_local` is a partitioned column, using date range filters helps BigQuery scan only the relevant partitions.

     - **Modify Date Filters:**

       ```sql
       WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
         AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
       ```

       - This ensures proper partition pruning if the table is partitioned on `date_local`.

   - **Narrow the Date Range Further:**

     - Limit your query to a single month or day to significantly reduce data scanned.

     ```sql
     WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
       AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'
     ```

   - **Additional Filters:**

     - If possible, add more conditions to the `WHERE` clause to further narrow down the data, such as filtering by specific `county_name`.

2. **Avoid Using `SELECT DISTINCT` If Possible:**

   - The `DISTINCT` keyword requires scanning all matching records to identify unique values.
   - If you can proceed without needing distinct values, remove `DISTINCT` to reduce data scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT `site_num`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
     AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Estimate Data Scanned Before Executing:**

   - In the BigQuery UI, you can see an estimate of the amount of data the query will scan.
   - Review this estimate and adjust your query accordingly to stay within your quota.

4. **Enable Billing to Increase Quota:**

   - **Set Up Billing:**
     - Enabling billing in your Google Cloud project increases your query quota.
     - New accounts receive $300 in free credits, and BigQuery offers 1 TB of free query data per month.

   - **Considerations:**
     - Ensure you monitor costs to avoid unexpected charges.
     - Review Google's pricing and free tier details.

5. **Use Public Datasets in Alternative Formats:**

   - **Download Data for Local Analysis:**
     - Access the data directly from the EPA's website at [EPA AirData](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data).
     - Download CSV files for the pollutants and date range you're interested in.

   - **Process Data Locally:**
     - Use tools like **Python**, **R**, **Excel**, or **SQL** databases to analyze the data without BigQuery quotas.

6. **Sample the Data:**

   - **Use Approximate Methods (Sampling):**
     - While BigQuery doesn't support `TABLESAMPLE`, you can simulate sampling using a hash function.

     ```sql
     SELECT `site_num`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
     WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
       AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
       AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(`site_num` AS STRING))), 10) = 1
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     - This selects approximately 10% of the data.
     - Note: This method may still exceed the quota if the dataset is large.

### **Additional Recommendations**

- **Check Table Schema and Size:**

  - Review the table's documentation to understand its size and partitioning.
  - For `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`, confirm if it's partitioned and on which column.

- **Use Preview Features:**

  - In the BigQuery UI, use the table preview option to view a sample of the data without consuming quota.

- **Monitor Quota Usage:**

  - Keep track of your project's quota usage in the Google Cloud Console.

- **Alternative Data Sources:**

  - **EPA APIs:**
    - Utilize the EPA's AirData API to retrieve specific data without scanning large datasets.
    - [EPA AirData API Documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html)

---

### **Summary**

- **Syntax Errors:**

  - Ensure all string literals are properly enclosed with matching single quotes `'`.
  - Use backticks ``` ` ``` for identifiers (if necessary), not for string literals.

- **Quota Exceeded Errors:**

  - BigQuery charges are based on data scanned, not the amount of data returned.
  - To reduce data scanned:
    - Use precise date ranges aligned with table partitioning.
    - Limit the data range to smaller periods (e.g., a single month or day).
    - Avoid using `DISTINCT` when possible.
    - Add additional filters to narrow down the dataset.

- **Alternative Methods:**

  - **Enable Billing:**
    - Increases your query quota, allowing larger queries.
    - Monitor usage to manage costs.
