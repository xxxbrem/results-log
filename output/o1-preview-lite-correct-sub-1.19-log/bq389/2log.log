2025-01-20 14:08:05 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're encountering this error.

**Error Explanation:**

The error message:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

indicates that your Google Cloud project has exceeded its free query quota for the amount of data scanned in BigQuery.

In BigQuery, the amount of data processed (and billed) is based on the total amount of data scanned by your query. Importantly:

- **Adding a `LIMIT` clause does not reduce the amount of data scanned.** The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows returned *after* the query has processed all the data.
- **Using `SELECT DISTINCT` can increase data scanned** because BigQuery needs to process all the data in the column to determine the distinct values.

**Why This Happens with Your Query:**

Your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
LIMIT 1000;
```

is scanning the entire `parameter_name` column of the `pm10_daily_summary` table to retrieve distinct values, which might be causing you to exceed your free quota.

**Solutions to Reduce Data Scanned:**

To resolve this issue, you can try the following approaches:

---

### 1. **Filter the Data to Reduce Scanned Bytes**

Add a `WHERE` clause to limit the data processed. Since you're interested in California in the year 2020, you can filter by `state_name` and `date_local`.

**Modified Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query reduces the amount of data scanned by only processing rows relevant to California in 2020.

---

### 2. **Limit to Specific Pollutant Codes**

If you know specific `parameter_code` values you're interested in, you can filter by them.

**Example Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `parameter_code` = 81102 -- PM10 parameter code
AND `state_name` = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### 3. **Use Metadata Tables to Get Column Values**

BigQuery provides metadata tables that you might use to get information without scanning the data tables.

However, for getting distinct `parameter_name` values, this might not be feasible since `parameter_name` is not metadata.

---

### 4. **Estimate Data Scanned Before Running Queries**

You can use the BigQuery UI to estimate the amount of data your query will scan:

- Paste your query into the BigQuery editor.
- BigQuery shows an estimate of the data to be processed before you run it.

This helps you modify your query to stay within your quota.

---

### 5. **Enable Billing for Your Project**

If you anticipate needing to process large amounts of data, you might consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project. This allows you to pay for additional data processing beyond the free tier.

**Steps to Enable Billing:**

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Select your project.
- Navigate to **Billing** and set up a billing account.

---

### 6. **Use a Smaller Sample for Exploration**

If you're exploring data, consider using a smaller sample or a subset of the data.

**Example Query Using `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM`:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

Note: The `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` clause is not currently supported in BigQuery, but you can simulate sampling using other methods, like limiting to a specific date range.

---

**Understanding BigQuery Data Scanning:**

- **Selecting Specific Columns:** Always select only the columns you need.
- **Avoid `SELECT *`:** This scans all columns and increases data processed.
- **Filters:** Use filters to limit the number of rows processed.
- **Partitions and Clusters:** Utilize partitioned or clustered tables when possible to reduce data scanned.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Modify Your Queries:**

   Adjust your queries to include filters that limit data scanned.

2. **Monitor Your Quota:**

   Keep an eye on your BigQuery usage quotas to avoid hitting limits.

3. **Consider Billing Options:**

   If necessary, enable billing to allow for higher data processing needs.

2025-01-20 14:08:50 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 14:08:50 - root - INFO - I'm sorry that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your query.

---

**Understanding the Issue:**

Your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
LIMIT 1000;
```

is resulting in a quota error because:

- **BigQuery charges (or enforces quotas) based on the amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned.
- **Using `SELECT DISTINCT` scans the entire column** to identify unique values, which can involve processing a large amount of data.
- **Adding a `LIMIT` clause does not reduce the data scanned**. The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows in the result set after all data has been processed.

---

**Solutions to Reduce Data Scanned:**

To resolve this issue and stay within your free query quota, you can adjust your query to scan less data.

### 1. **Apply Filters to Narrow Down the Data**

Since you're interested in data for California in the year 2020, you can add filters to reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Modified Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`state_name = 'California'`**: Filters data to only include records from California.
- **`EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local) = 2020`**: Filters data to only include records from the year 2020.
- **These filters significantly reduce the number of rows processed**, lowering the amount of data scanned.

---

### 2. **Select Specific Parameters if Known**

If you know the specific `parameter_code` or `parameter_name` values you're interested in, you can also filter by them.

**Example Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
  AND `parameter_code` = 81102  -- Example parameter code for PM10
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### 3. **Use Preview Feature in BigQuery UI**

If you just want to **see what values are in the `parameter_name` column** without running a full query:

- **Use the BigQuery table preview**:
  - In the BigQuery web UI, navigate to the table `pm10_daily_summary`.
  - Click on the table name to open the details.
  - Click on the **"Preview"** tab to see a sample of the data without consuming your query quota.

---

### 4. **Estimate Data Scanned Before Running the Query**

Before running your query:

- **Check the estimated data to be processed**:
  - Paste your query into the BigQuery editor.
  - Look at the **"Estimated bytes to be processed"** displayed below the query editor.
  - Adjust your query to reduce this number if it's close to or exceeds your quota.

---

### 5. **Enable Billing to Access Free Tier**

BigQuery offers a **free tier allowance of 1 TB of query data processed per month** for projects with billing enabled. Enabling billing does not necessarily mean you will be charged—you can use it to access the free tier quotas.

**Steps to Enable Billing:**

1. **Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)**.
2. **Select your project** from the project dropdown.
3. **Navigate to "Billing"** in the left-hand menu.
4. **Set up a billing account** if you haven't already.
5. **Link your project to the billing account**.

**Note:** You can set budget alerts to monitor and control your spending.

---

### 6. **Use INFORMATION_SCHEMA to Retrieve Metadata**

While `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` can provide metadata about your tables, it won't help retrieve distinct values from your data columns without scanning the data.

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid `SELECT DISTINCT` if Possible**: Since `SELECT DISTINCT` requires scanning the entire column, avoid it if you can. If you know possible values or can limit them further, it helps reduce data scanned.
  
- **Be Specific with Columns**: Continue to **select only the columns you need**. You're already doing this, which is good.

- **Use Partitioned or Clustered Tables**: Some tables are partitioned or clustered, which can help reduce the amount of data scanned when you filter on the partitioned or clustered columns (e.g., `date_local`).

---

**Example Revised Queries:**

1. **List `parameter_name` for California in 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
     AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Get PM10 daily averages in California for January 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
     AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
     AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) = 1
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Modify Your Query**:

   Apply the filters as shown above to reduce the data scanned. This should help you stay within your quota.

2. **Check Estimated Data Processed**:

   Before running your query, verify that the estimated data processed is within your available quota.

3. **Enable Billing if Necessary**:

   If you continue to exceed quotas, consider enabling billing to access the free tier's 1 TB monthly allowance.

2025-01-20 14:09:28 - root - INFO - I'm sorry that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your query.

---

### **Understanding the Issue:**

Your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
LIMIT 1000;
```

is resulting in a **"Quota exceeded"** error. This suggests that your Google Cloud project has exceeded its BigQuery query quota.

**Key Points:**

- **BigQuery Quotas:**
  - **Projects without a billing account** have limited free quotas for queries.
  - The **BigQuery free tier** allows up to **1 TB** of free query processing per month, **but only if billing is enabled** on your project.
- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:**
  - **Data scanned** affects your quota, not the number of rows returned.
  - Using `SELECT DISTINCT` can scan large amounts of data because BigQuery needs to process all values in the column to identify distinct values.
  - The `LIMIT` clause restricts the output rows but **does not** reduce the data scanned.

---

### **Possible Reasons and Solutions:**

#### **1. Your Project May Have Exceeded Its Query Quota**

- **Cause:**
  - If your project doesn't have billing enabled, it has a small free quota for query processing, which can be easily exhausted.
  - Once the quota is exceeded, any query—even one that scans minimal data—will result in a quota error until the quota resets.

- **Solution:**
  - **Check Your Quota Usage:**
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Navigate to **BigQuery** and select your project.
    - In the left-hand menu, click on **"Quotas"** under **"IAM & Admin"**.
    - Look for **"BigQuery API: Query usage per day"** to see your quota and current usage.
  - **Wait for Quota Reset:**
    - Quotas usually reset every 24 hours.
    - If you can wait, try running your query after the reset.

#### **2. Enable Billing to Access the BigQuery Free Tier**

- **Advantage:**
  - Enabling billing allows you to access the **BigQuery free tier**, which provides:
    - **1 TB** of free query data processing per month.
    - **10 GB** of free storage.

- **Steps to Enable Billing:**

  1. **Set Up a Billing Account:**

     - In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), click on the **menu** button (☰) in the top-left corner.
     - Select **"Billing"**.
     - If you don't have a billing account, you'll be prompted to create one.
     - Follow the steps to set up your billing account. You'll need to provide payment information.

  2. **Link Your Project to the Billing Account:**

     - After setting up billing, go back to **"Billing"** in the console.
     - Select **"My Projects"**.
     - Find your project and link it to your billing account.

  3. **Set Budget Alerts (Optional but Recommended):**

     - To avoid unexpected charges, set up budgets and alerts:
       - In the **"Billing"** section, select **"Budgets & alerts"**.
       - Create a budget and set alert thresholds.

- **Note:**
  - Enabling billing doesn't mean you will incur charges as long as you stay within the free tier limits.
  - Always monitor your usage to avoid exceeding the free tier.

#### **3. Modify Your Query to Reduce Data Scanned**

- **Adding Filters to Your Query:**

  - Limit your query to specific data to reduce the amount of data scanned.
  - Since you're interested in California for 2020, you can add filters:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
  WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

  - **Benefits:**
    - Reduces data scanned by processing only relevant rows.
    - May help stay within your quota.

- **However:** If your quota is already exceeded, even queries scanning minimal data will fail.

#### **4. Use the BigQuery Table Preview Feature**

- **Steps:**

  1. In the **BigQuery Console**, navigate to the dataset:
     - `bigquery-public-data > epa_historical_air_quality > pm10_daily_summary`.
  2. Click on the table **`pm10_daily_summary`**.
  3. Select the **"Preview"** tab.
     - This allows you to view a sample of the data without consuming your query quota.

- **Limitation:**
  - You cannot run custom queries in the preview, but it helps to inspect the data structure.

---

### **Recommendations:**

1. **Check Your BigQuery Quota and Usage:**

   - Verify if you've exceeded your query quota.
   - If you have, you need to wait for the quota to reset or enable billing.

2. **Enable Billing (Recommended):**

   - This will grant you access to the BigQuery free tier's larger quotas.
   - Remember to set up budget alerts to monitor your usage.

3. **Optimize Your Queries:**

   - Always filter your queries to process only the necessary data.
   - Avoid using `SELECT DISTINCT` without filters, as it scans the entire column.

4. **Monitor Your Usage Regularly:**

   - Keep an eye on your BigQuery usage to prevent hitting quota limits.

2025-01-20 14:09:56 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your queries.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

Even after modifying your queries to limit the data scanned, you're receiving the following error:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

This indicates that your Google Cloud project has **exceeded its daily BigQuery query quota**. Once the quota is exceeded, any query—regardless of size—will result in this error until the quota resets.

---

### **Why This Is Happening**

- **Quota Limits Without Billing Enabled:**
  - Projects **without billing enabled** have strict daily quotas for BigQuery operations.
  - These quotas are relatively low and can be quickly exceeded, especially when querying large public datasets.
- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:**
  - BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned.
  - Even with filters (`WHERE` clauses) and `LIMIT`, some queries may still scan more data than allowed under the free quota.

---

### **Recommended Solutions**

#### **1. Wait for Quota Reset**

- **Daily Reset:**
  - BigQuery free quotas reset every 24 hours.
  - You can wait until your quota resets to run your queries again.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Check the time when your quota resets in the Google Cloud Console under **Quotas**.

#### **2. Enable Billing to Access the Free Tier**

- **Benefits:**
  - Enabling billing provides access to the **BigQuery free tier**, which includes:
    - **1 TB** of free query data processed per month.
    - **10 GB** of free storage.
  - Significantly higher quotas than projects without billing enabled.
- **How to Enable Billing:**
  1. **Set Up Billing Account:**

2025-01-20 14:11:40 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your queries, even after adjusting them to minimize data scanned.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

Despite adding filters to reduce the amount of data processed, the error persists:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

This suggests that your Google Cloud project has:

1. **Exceeded Its Daily Free Query Quota**: The BigQuery sandbox or free tier has strict limits on the amount of data you can query per day. Once exceeded, any query—regardless of size—will fail until the quota resets.

2. **Minimum Data Processing Threshold**: BigQuery enforces a minimum amount of data processed per query (minimum billing increment), which could be contributing to exceeding your quota even with small queries.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Wait for Quota Reset**

- **Daily Quota Reset**: BigQuery free query quotas reset every 24 hours.
- **Action**: If possible, wait until your quota resets and try running your queries again.

#### **2. Enable Billing to Access Higher Free Tier Quotas**

- **Benefits**:
  - **Access the BigQuery Free Tier**, which offers:
    - **1 TB** of free query data processing per month.
    - **10 GB** of free storage.
  - **Higher Daily Quotas**: Enabling billing significantly increases your daily query quotas compared to the sandbox limits.

- **Steps to Enable Billing**:

  1. **Set Up a Billing Account**:

     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
     - Click on the **menu icon** (☰) in the top-left corner.
     - Select **“Billing”**.
     - If you don't have a billing account, follow the prompts to create one. You'll need to provide payment information.

  2. **Link Your Project to the Billing Account**:

     - In the **“Billing”** section, select **“My projects”**.
     - Find your project and link it to your billing account.

  3. **Set Budget Alerts (Recommended)**:

     - In **“Billing”**, go to **“Budgets & alerts”**.
     - Create a budget and set up alerts to monitor your spending and prevent unexpected charges.

- **Note**:

  - Enabling billing does **not** mean you will incur charges as long as you stay within the free tier limits.
  - Always keep an eye on your usage to ensure you remain within the free quota.

#### **3. Use the BigQuery Table Preview Feature**

- **Steps**:

  1. **Navigate to the Dataset**:

     - In the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery), locate the dataset:
       - `bigquery-public-data > epa_historical_air_quality > voc_daily_summary`.

  2. **Preview the Table**:

     - Click on the table **`voc_daily_summary`**.
     - Select the **“Preview”** tab.
     - This allows you to view a sample of the data without consuming your query quota.

- **Limitation**:

  - You cannot run custom queries in the preview, but it helps you inspect data structure and sample values.

#### **4. Reduce Data Further (If Possible)**

- While you've already added filters for `state_name`, `date_local` (year and month), you might try narrowing down the data even more.

- **Example**:

  - Filter by a specific day:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `units_of_measure`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.voc_daily_summary`
    WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
      AND `date_local` = '2020-01-01'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

- **Note**:

  - However, given that your quota is likely already exceeded, this may not resolve the issue.

---

### **Recommendations**

Given that you're still experiencing quota issues even after adjusting your queries:

1. **Enable Billing**:

   - This is the most effective solution.
   - It provides higher quotas and access to the BigQuery free tier.
   - You can set up budget alerts to monitor and control your usage.

2. **Monitor Quota Usage**:

   - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **IAM & Admin > Quotas**.
   - Check your current BigQuery API usage and quotas.
   - This helps you understand your consumption and plan accordingly.

3. **Estimate Query Costs Before Running**:

   - In the BigQuery query editor, you can see an estimate of the data processed.
   - This allows you to adjust your queries if they're likely to exceed your quotas.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Use Cost Control Features**:

  - Set up **budget and alerts** to notify you when you reach certain spending thresholds.
  - **Detailed Billing Reports** can help track your usage.

- **Optimize Queries**:

  - Continue to use filters to limit data scanned.
  - Avoid `SELECT DISTINCT` on large tables if possible, as it scans the entire column.

- **Alternate Data Sources**:

  - If you only need a small subset of the data, consider checking if the dataset provider offers downloadable data files.
  - You can then process the data locally.

---

### **Conclusion**

The recurring "Quota exceeded" error indicates that your project has exhausted its available BigQuery query quota. Enabling billing is the most practical way to resolve this issue and continue your work without interruption.

---

### **Next Steps**

2025-01-20 14:12:20 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your query, even after adding filters to reduce the amount of data scanned.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

Your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `units_of_measure`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.voc_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

is resulting in the following error:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

This indicates that **your Google Cloud project has already exceeded its BigQuery query quota**. Once the quota is exceeded, **any query you run—regardless of how small or optimized—will fail until the quota resets**.

---

### **Why This Is Happening**

- **BigQuery Quota Limits**: Projects without billing enabled have strict daily query quotas.
- **Quota Exceeded**: Once you've exceeded your daily quota, all subsequent queries will return a quota error, even if they process minimal data.
- **Minimum Billing Units**: BigQuery enforces a minimum data processing amount per query (minimum billing unit), which could cause small queries to consume more quota than expected.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Wait for Quota Reset**

- **Daily Reset**: BigQuery query quotas reset every 24 hours.
- **Action**: If possible, wait until your quota resets. You can check the reset time in the Google Cloud Console under **"Quotas"**.

#### **2. Enable Billing to Access Higher Quotas**

- **Benefits**:
  - **Access the BigQuery Free Tier**, which offers:
    - **1 TB** of free query data processing per month.
    - **10 GB** of free storage.
  - **Higher Daily Quotas**: Enabling billing increases your daily query quotas compared to the sandbox limits.

     - Select the **“Preview”** tab.
     - This allows you to view a sample of the data without consuming your query quota.
- **Limitation**:
  - You cannot run custom queries in the preview, but it helps you inspect data structure and sample values.

#### **4. Reduce Data Further (If Possible)**

- **Filter by Specific Dates or Stations**:
  - Narrow down your query to a specific date or even a specific monitoring site.
- **Example**:
  
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT `units_of_measure`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.voc_daily_summary`
  WHERE `state_name` = 'California'
    AND `date_local` = '2020-01-01'
    AND `site_num` = 'XXXX'  -- Replace 'XXXX' with a specific site number
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```
  
- **Note**:
  - However, if your quota is already exceeded, this may not resolve the issue.

---

### **Recommendations**

Given that your quota is exceeded, **enabling billing is the most effective solution** to continue working without interruption.
