**Reasoning:**

After comparing both SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the more appropriate query for the task.

Here's why:

1. **Efficient Data Processing:**
   - `2result.sql` uses a **Common Table Expression (CTE)** with the `WITH` clause to process the data in a single pass. It retrieves all relevant trades, calculates the intrinsic values, and assigns strategies in one step.
   - In contrast, `1result.sql` performs two separate subqueries, each scanning the table individually for the 'feeling-lucky' and 'momentum' strategies, which is less efficient.

2. **Clear Strategy Assignment:**
   - `2result.sql` utilizes a `CASE` statement to clearly define the strategies (`'feeling-lucky'`, `'momentum'`, or `'other'`) based on the `TargetCompID`. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.
   - `1result.sql` directly filters using `LIKE` conditions within each subquery, which can be less flexible if additional strategies need to be added in the future.

3. **Robustness Against Missing Data:**
   - By handling the strategies within a single dataset, `2result.sql` ensures that if there are no trades for one of the strategies, the query will still execute without errors.
   - In `1result.sql`, if either subquery returns no rows (e.g., no 'momentum' trades), the entire query might fail or return `NULL` due to missing data in the subquery.

4. **Single Aggregation Step:**
   - `2result.sql` performs the aggregation and difference calculation in a single step, which is efficient and reduces complexity.
   - `1result.sql` calculates averages separately and then computes the difference, introducing additional steps.

5. **Consistent Results:**
   - Both queries yield the same result (`0.0231`), indicating they are functionally similar. However, the method used in `2result.sql` is more aligned with best practices for SQL query writing.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` is the correct choice as it provides a more efficient, readable, and robust approach to calculating the difference in average intrinsic values between the 'feeling-lucky' and 'momentum' strategies under long-side trades.
