2025-01-20 13:10:10 - root - INFO - It appears that you received a "Quota exceeded" error because your query scans a large amount of data. The `SELECT DISTINCT company` query requires BigQuery to process the entire `taxi_trips` table to identify all unique companies. Even with the `LIMIT` clause, BigQuery must scan the whole table to ensure all distinct values are found, which can exceed your project's free query quota.

To avoid exceeding your quota, you can modify your queries to limit the amount of data scanned by adding a `WHERE` clause that restricts the data to a smaller timeframe, such as a specific month in 2018.

---

**Considered tables and columns:**

From the table `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`:

- **`company`**: Identifies the taxi company for each trip.
  - *Potential usage*: To group trips by company.
- **`trip_start_timestamp`**: Timestamp when the trip started.
  - *Potential usage*: To extract the month and year of each trip for monthly grouping.
- **`unique_key`**: Unique identifier for each trip.
  - *Potential usage*: To count the number of trips.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter trips that occurred in a specific month in **2018** (e.g., January): `trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'`.
- Extract the month and year from `trip_start_timestamp` to group trips by month and year: `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp)` and `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp)`.

---

Here are 10 simple, short, non-nested BigQuery SQL queries that limit the data scanned:

1. **List distinct taxi companies for January 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT company
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve trip start timestamps for trips in January 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT trip_start_timestamp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get companies and their trips' start dates in January 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Extract months from trip start timestamps in the first quarter of 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-04-01'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **List unique trip IDs and their companies for January 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT unique_key, company
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Get distinct days when trips occurred in January 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(DAY FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS day
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
   ORDER BY day
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Retrieve companies and trip distances for trips in January 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, trip_miles
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Fetch companies and fare amounts for trips in January 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, fare
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **List trip start dates and corresponding companies in January 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date, company
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Get companies and the day of the month when trips started in January 2018:**

    ```sql
    SELECT company, EXTRACT(DAY FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS day
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries focus on data within January 2018, significantly reducing the amount of data scanned and helping you stay within your query quota. Make sure to adjust the date ranges or add additional filters as needed to explore other months or data subsets.

**Note:** When working with large datasets in BigQuery, even queries with `LIMIT` can scan a significant amount of data because `LIMIT` only limits the number of rows returned, not the amount of data scanned. To minimize data scanned:

- **Use Filters:** Apply `WHERE` clauses to restrict the data processed.
- **Partition Pruning:** If the table is partitioned (e.g., by date), ensure your filters allow BigQuery to prune partitions.
- **Select Specific Columns:** Only select the columns you need.
- **Sample Data:** Use `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` (if available) to sample the data.

**Example of sampling data (if supported):**

```sql
SELECT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
LIMIT 1000;
```

If `TABLESAMPLE` is not supported, you can simulate sampling with a condition:

```sql
SELECT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key) % 100 = 0
LIMIT 1000;
```

This samples approximately 1% of the data based on the hash of `unique_key`.

**Additional Tip:**

Before running a query, you can estimate the amount of data it will scan:

- **In the BigQuery UI**, after writing your query, hover over the "Query" button to see the estimated bytes processed.
- **Use the `EXPLAIN` statement** to get detailed information about the query execution plan without running the query.

---

By adjusting your queries to process smaller subsets of data, you can explore the dataset without exceeding your quota. Let me know if you need further assistance or have questions about specific queries.
2025-01-20 13:10:57 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 13:10:57 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering a "Quota exceeded" error when attempting to run the query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`

```

This error occurs because querying large datasets in BigQuery can exceed the free query quota, even with a `LIMIT` clause. The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows returned **after** processing the query but does not reduce the amount of data scanned during query execution. In BigQuery, operations like `SELECT DISTINCT` require scanning the entire column to identify unique values, which can process a significant amount of data and exceed your project's query quota.

---

**Let's revisit the task and figure out the best possible approach given the constraints.**

### **Task Overview**

**Question:**

*Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?*

**Goal:**

- Identify the top three companies with the largest increase in the number of trips between any two consecutive months in 2018.
- Provide the results in a simple CSV format, including a brief explanation.

### **Relevant Tables and Columns**

From the table `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`, the relevant columns are:

- **`company`** (`STRING`): The taxi company for each trip.
  - *Usage*: To group and identify trips by company.
- **`trip_start_timestamp`** (`TIMESTAMP`): The start time of each trip.
  - *Usage*: To determine the month and year of each trip for monthly grouping.
- **`unique_key`** (`STRING`): A unique identifier for each trip.
  - *Usage*: To count the number of trips accurately.

### **Conditions to Apply**

- **Filter for the year 2018**: Only consider trips that occurred in 2018.
- **Group data by company and month**: To calculate monthly trip counts per company.
- **Calculate the increase between consecutive months**: To find the changes in trip numbers.

---

### **Approach to Solve the Task**

Given the limitations, we cannot execute queries on the dataset directly. However, we can outline how to approach the problem:

1. **Filter Trips for 2018:**

   - Consider only trips where the `trip_start_timestamp` falls within the year 2018.

2. **Extract Year and Month:**

   - Extract the year and month from `trip_start_timestamp` to group trips by month.

3. **Count Trips per Company per Month:**

   - Group the trips by `company`, `year`, and `month`.
   - Calculate the count of trips (`trip_count`) for each company in each month.

4. **Calculate Monthly Increases:**

   - For each company, calculate the difference in `trip_count` between consecutive months.
   - This involves joining the monthly counts for each company with the counts from the previous month.

5. **Identify Largest Increases:**

   - For each company, identify the maximum increase in trip numbers between any two consecutive months in 2018.
   - Compare these maximum increases across all companies.

6. **Select Top Three Companies:**

   - Sort the companies based on their largest increase in descending order.
   - Select the top three companies with the largest increases.

---

### **Expected Answer Format**

As per the instructions, the answer should be provided in CSV format:

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int(Attention: answer in this order)
```

- **`Company_name`**: The name of the taxi company (`STRING`).
- **`Largest_increase`**: The largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months (`INT`).

---

### **Explanation**

This table would list the three companies that experienced the largest increases in the number of trips between any two consecutive months in 2018. Each row contains:

- **Company_name**: The taxi company that had the increase.
- **Largest_increase**: The numerical value of the largest increase in trip numbers for that company between two consecutive months.

**Note:** Without access to the actual data due to quota limitations, we cannot provide specific company names or exact increase values.

---

### **Alternative Solutions**

Since we cannot execute queries on the full dataset, here are some alternative approaches:

1. **Use a Smaller Sample of Data:**

   - If possible, obtain a smaller sample of the dataset that fits within your query quota.
   - Perform the analysis on this sample, keeping in mind that the results may not reflect the full dataset.

2. **Increase Quota Limits:**

   - Consider upgrading your BigQuery account or project to increase the query quota.
   - This may involve enabling billing or contacting Google Cloud support.

3. **Leverage Publicly Available Summaries:**

   - Check if there are any publicly available summaries or reports on Chicago taxi trips for 2018.
   - Some analyses or datasets might already contain aggregated data that can help answer the question.

---

### **Closing**

Unfortunately, due to the query quota limitations, we are unable to retrieve and process the required data to provide the exact answer. However, the method outlined above describes the steps necessary to solve the task when the data is accessible.

If you manage to access the data or resolve the quota issue, you can apply the described approach to obtain the desired results. Let me know if you need further assistance or guidance on specific steps within the outlined method.

2025-01-20 13:12:14 - root - INFO - **Considered Tables and Columns:**

From the table `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`:

- **`company`** (`STRING`): The taxi company for each trip.
  - *Potential usage*: To group trips by company.
- **`trip_start_timestamp`** (`TIMESTAMP`): The start time of each trip.
  - *Potential usage*: To extract the month and year for grouping trips monthly.
- **`unique_key`** (`STRING`): Unique identifier for each trip.
  - *Potential usage*: To count the number of trips accurately.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter trips to the year 2018**: `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018`.
- **Extract the month** from `trip_start_timestamp` for monthly grouping: `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp)`.

---

Since you're encountering quota limitations that prevent you from querying the dataset, we can outline the approach without executing the queries.

**Approach to Solve the Task:**

1. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   - Group trips by `company` and `month` for the year 2018.
   - Count the number of trips (`trip_count`) for each company in each month.

2. **Calculate Monthly Increases for Each Company:**

   - For each company, calculate the difference in `trip_count` between consecutive months.
   - Identify the increase in trip numbers between each pair of consecutive months.

3. **Determine the Largest Increase per Company:**

   - For each company, find the maximum increase in trip numbers between any two consecutive months in 2018.

4. **Identify the Top Three Companies:**

   - Compare the largest increases of all companies.
   - Select the three companies with the highest increases.

---

**Final Answer:**

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int(Attention: answer in this order)
```

This table lists the three companies with the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018. Each row contains:

- **Company_name**: The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase**: The maximum increase in the number of trips the company experienced between any two consecutive months in 2018.

**Explanation:**

Due to quota limitations, we cannot provide the exact company names or numerical values. However, the approach involves analyzing the monthly trip counts for each company and calculating the differences between consecutive months to find the largest increases. By sorting these maximum increases in descending order, we identify the top three companies as per the task's requirement.

---

**Note:**

To obtain the actual values, you would need to run queries on the dataset when the quota issue is resolved or consider using a smaller subset of the data that fits within your query limits. Keep in mind that even with a `LIMIT` clause, operations like `DISTINCT` and aggregations still require scanning the entire dataset, which can exceed your quota.

**Suggestions to Manage Quota:**

- **Use Data Sampling:** If possible, sample a smaller portion of the data.
- **Limit Date Range Further:** Focus on specific months rather than the entire year.
- **Reduce Columns Queried:** Select only the necessary columns to minimize data scanned.
- **Upgrade Quota:** Consider increasing your BigQuery quota if feasible.

Let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on any of the steps.

2025-01-20 13:13:34 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering "Quota exceeded" errors when attempting to run the adjusted SQL query:

```sql
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE DATE(trip_start_timestamp) = '2018-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

Despite narrowing the query to a single day and limiting the number of rows returned, the error persists:

> **403 Quota exceeded**: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.

---

### **Explanation**

The reason you're seeing this error is that the `LIMIT` clause in BigQuery limits the number of **rows returned** but does **not** limit the amount of data scanned during query execution. Even when querying data for a single day, if the table is not partitioned and the column used in the `WHERE` clause is not indexed, BigQuery may need to scan the entire table to find the matching rows.

The `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is a large dataset containing millions of rows and several gigabytes of data. Scanning this table, even for a small subset of data, can quickly exceed the free query quota provided by BigQuery.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

Given the quota limitations and the inability to execute the necessary queries, we face challenges in proceeding with the task. However, here are some suggestions:

1. **Check for Table Partitioning and Clustering:**

   - The `taxi_trips` table may be partitioned by date. You can utilize partition pruning to limit the amount of data scanned.
   - To query partitioned data efficiently, you can use the `_PARTITIONTIME` pseudo-column.

   **Example Query Using Partitioned Table (if applicable):**

   ```sql
   SELECT trip_start_timestamp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = '2018-01-01'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Note:** Check if the table supports partitioning by examining its schema or metadata. If it is not partitioned, this method will not apply.

2. **Use a Smaller Sample Dataset:**

   - BigQuery allows you to create temporary tables or views with a subset of data.
   - Since we cannot query the main table due to quota issues, we might consider using a publicly available smaller dataset or sample data.

3. **Increase Your Query Quota:**

   - Consider enabling billing for your Google Cloud project. This will increase your query quota and allow you to process larger amounts of data.
   - With billing enabled, you pay for the data you process, and the free tier limitations no longer apply.

4. **Leverage Existing Aggregated Data (if available):**

   - Check if there are pre-aggregated tables or summaries available within the `bigquery-public-data` datasets.
   - Sometimes, datasets include summarized versions of the data to facilitate quick analysis without scanning large tables.

5. **Alternative Approach Without Executing Queries:**

   - Since we cannot access the data directly, we can outline the **methodology** to solve the problem.
   - This involves describing the steps you would take if you had access to the data.

---

### **Methodology to Solve the Task**

Given the constraints, here's how you would approach the task:

1. **Filter Trips for the Year 2018:**

   - Focus on trips where `trip_start_timestamp` falls within the year 2018.

2. **Extract Month and Year:**

   - Use `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp)` to get the month.
   - Use `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp)` to ensure the year is 2018.

3. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   - Group the data by `company`, `year`, and `month`.
   - Count the number of trips for each company in each month.

   **Sample Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
     COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
   GROUP BY
     company, year, month;
   ```

4. **Calculate Monthly Trip Increases per Company:**

   - For each company, calculate the difference in `trip_count` between each pair of consecutive months.
   - This involves joining the monthly trip counts with themselves offset by one month.

   **Sample Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     curr.company,
     curr.month AS current_month,
     curr.trip_count AS current_trip_count,
     prev.month AS previous_month,
     prev.trip_count AS previous_trip_count,
     (curr.trip_count - prev.trip_count) AS trip_increase
   FROM
     monthly_trip_counts AS curr
   JOIN
     monthly_trip_counts AS prev
   ON
     curr.company = prev.company
     AND curr.month = prev.month + 1;
   ```

5. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company:**

   - For each company, find the maximum `trip_increase` across all months.
   - This gives the largest increase in trip numbers between any two consecutive months for each company.

6. **Select the Top Three Companies:**

   - Order the companies by their largest `trip_increase` in descending order.
   - Select the top three companies.

   **Sample Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     MAX(trip_increase) AS largest_increase
   FROM
     company_trip_increases
   GROUP BY
     company
   ORDER BY
     largest_increase DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

---

### **Conclusion**

Due to the quota limitations, we cannot execute these queries to obtain the actual results. However, the methodology outlined above provides a clear path to solving the task when resources are available.

**Recommendations:**

- **Enable Billing:** If possible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to allow larger queries.
- **Use Smaller Datasets:** If you have access to a smaller dataset or can obtain the data in a different format, you could perform the analysis there.
- **Contact Support:** If you believe there is an issue with your quota settings, consider reaching out to Google Cloud support for assistance.

---

### **Final Answer Format**

Since we cannot provide the actual data, here is the expected answer format as per your instructions:

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int(Attention: answer in this order)
```

Each row represents one of the top three companies with the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018.

2025-01-20 13:14:32 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 13:14:32 - root - INFO - **Understanding the Error:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
400 Table "monthly_trip_counts" must be qualified with a dataset (e.g. dataset.table).; reason: invalid, location: monthly_trip_counts, message: Table "monthly_trip_counts" must be qualified with a dataset (e.g. dataset.table).
```

indicates that BigQuery cannot find or recognize the table `monthly_trip_counts`. This is because `monthly_trip_counts` is not an existing table in the dataset; it was referenced in an earlier example as an alias or a Common Table Expression (CTE) without being properly defined.

**Why the Error Occurred:**

In a previous response, I provided example queries that used `monthly_trip_counts` without a proper definition. When you attempt to run queries that reference `monthly_trip_counts` without defining it within the query or without it existing as a table in your dataset, BigQuery returns an error.

**Correcting the SQL Queries:**

To fix this error, we need to define `monthly_trip_counts` within the query using a CTE. However, we also need to be mindful of the quota limits you're encountering. Running queries on large datasets like `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` can quickly exceed free tier quotas, even with `LIMIT` clauses, because BigQuery processes the entire dataset to execute the query.

Here's how to correct the queries while attempting to minimize data scanned:

---

**1. Define `monthly_trip_counts` Using a CTE:**

We need to define `monthly_trip_counts` within the query before referencing it.

```sql
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, year, month
)

SELECT
  curr.company,
  curr.month AS current_month,
  curr.trip_count AS current_trip_count,
  prev.month AS previous_month,
  prev.trip_count AS previous_trip_count,
  (curr.trip_count - prev.trip_count) AS trip_increase
FROM
  monthly_trip_counts AS curr
JOIN
  monthly_trip_counts AS prev
ON
  curr.company = prev.company
  AND curr.month = prev.month + 1
ORDER BY
  trip_increase DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Note:** This query calculates the monthly trip counts for each company in 2018 and then joins them to find the increase between consecutive months.

---

**2. Reduce Data Scanned to Avoid Quota Errors:**

Since querying the entire year's data exceeds your quota, we can limit the data by focusing on a specific month or sampling the data.

**Option A: Limit to a Specific Month**

```sql
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-03-01'
  GROUP BY
    company, month
)

SELECT
  curr.company,
  curr.month AS current_month,
  curr.trip_count AS current_trip_count,
  prev.month AS previous_month,
  prev.trip_count AS previous_trip_count,
  (curr.trip_count - prev.trip_count) AS trip_increase
FROM
  monthly_trip_counts AS curr
JOIN
  monthly_trip_counts AS prev
ON
  curr.company = prev.company
  AND curr.month = prev.month + 1
ORDER BY
  trip_increase DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query limits the data to January and February 2018.

**Option B: Sample the Data**

```sql
WITH sampled_data AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1
), monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM sampled_data
  GROUP BY
    company, month
)

SELECT
  curr.company,
  curr.month AS current_month,
  curr.trip_count AS current_trip_count,
  prev.month AS previous_month,
  prev.trip_count AS previous_trip_count,
  (curr.trip_count - prev.trip_count) AS trip_increase
FROM
  monthly_trip_counts AS curr
JOIN
  monthly_trip_counts AS prev
ON
  curr.company = prev.company
  AND curr.month = prev.month + 1
ORDER BY
  trip_increase DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query samples approximately 0.1% of the data, which may help stay within quota limits.

---

**3. Check if the Table Is Partitioned:**

If the `taxi_trips` table is partitioned by date, you can use partition filters to reduce the amount of data scanned.

```sql
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE _PARTITIONDATE = '2018-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** The `taxi_trips` table may not be partitioned. If it's not, this method won't reduce data scanned.

---

**4. Understand Limitations of the `LIMIT` Clause:**

Remember that the `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows returned, not the amount of data scanned. BigQuery processes the entire dataset that matches the `WHERE` clause before applying the `LIMIT`.

---

**Final Notes:**

Given the quota limitations, obtaining the exact data required to answer the task may not be feasible without increasing your project's quota or enabling billing.

---

**Proposed Answer:**

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int(Attention: answer in this order)
```

This table represents the three companies with the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018. Each row includes:

- **Company_name**: The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase**: The maximum increase in the number of trips between any two consecutive months.

**Explanation:**

Due to the quota errors, we are unable to execute the necessary queries to obtain the actual company names and increase values. However, the methodology provided outlines how to calculate these values when resources permit.

---

**Summary and Recommendations:**

- **Error Explanation**: The error occurred because `monthly_trip_counts` was referenced without being defined. This is corrected by defining it using a CTE.
- **Quota Limitations**: BigQuery's free tier has strict quotas, and querying large datasets like `taxi_trips` often exceeds these limits.
- **Possible Solutions**:
  - **Enable Billing**: Consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your query quota.
  - **Data Sampling**: Use data sampling to reduce the amount of data scanned.
  - **Reduce Date Range**: Limit queries to a smaller date range.
- **Methodology Provided**: The steps and corrected queries show how to approach the task when data access is feasible.

**Next Steps:**

- **Enable Billing (if possible)**: This allows you to process larger queries and avoid quota issues.
- **Adjust Queries**: Modify queries to scan less data, such as by sampling or limiting the date range further.
- **Use Aggregated Data**: If available, use pre-aggregated datasets that require less data to be scanned.

2025-01-20 13:15:46 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 13:15:46 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering "Quota exceeded" errors when attempting to run the query:

```sql
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE DATE(trip_start_timestamp) = '2018-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you're limiting the query to a specific date and limiting the number of rows returned, BigQuery may still scan a large portion of the dataset to process the query. This is because:

- **Limitations of `LIMIT`:** The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows **returned** but does not limit the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.
- **Table Size and Structure:** The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is very large, and unless it's partitioned or clustered on the `trip_start_timestamp` column, filtering by date may still require scanning the entire table.
- **Lack of Partition Pruning:** If the table isn't partitioned by date, BigQuery cannot prune partitions to reduce the data scanned.

**Possible Solutions:**

To reduce the amount of data scanned and avoid exceeding your query quota, here are some strategies:

1. **Use Partitioned Tables (if available):**

   Check if the `taxi_trips` table is partitioned by date. If it is, you can use the `_PARTITIONTIME` pseudo-column to limit the data scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT trip_start_timestamp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = '2018-01-01'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Note:** If the table is not partitioned, this method won't reduce data scanned.

2. **Use Hash-Based Sampling:**

   Sample a small fraction of the data to reduce the amount of data scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT trip_start_timestamp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   - This query samples approximately 0.1% of the data.
   - Adjust the modulus and comparison value to change the sample size.

3. **Select Fewer Columns:**

   Only select the columns you need. However, since you're already selecting a single column, this may not further reduce data scanned.

4. **Use a Smaller Date Range:**

   Instead of querying a full day, try querying a smaller time window.

   ```sql
   SELECT trip_start_timestamp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01 00:00:00' AND '2018-01-01 01:00:00'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   - This restricts the query to a specific hour.
   - Be aware that this may still scan a large amount of data if the column isn't indexed or partitioned.

5. **Check for Public Sample Tables:**

   Some datasets provide sample tables that are much smaller.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   - While this isn't the taxi trips data, it allows you to practice queries without exceeding quotas.

6. **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

   If possible, enable billing to increase your quota limits. With billing enabled, you can process larger amounts of data.

**Adjusted SQL Queries:**

Given the limitations, here are adjusted versions of your SQL queries using hash-based sampling:

1. **Sampled Trip Start Timestamps:**

   ```sql
   SELECT trip_start_timestamp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Sampled Companies and Trip Dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Extract Months from Sampled Data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Sampled Unique Trip IDs and Companies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT unique_key, company
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Distinct Months from Sampled Data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   ORDER BY month
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Sampled Companies and Trip Distances:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, trip_miles
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Sampled Companies and Fare Amounts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, fare
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Sampled Trip Dates and Corresponding Companies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date, company
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Sampled Companies and Days of the Month:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, EXTRACT(DAY FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS day
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Sampled Data for 2018 Only:**

    ```sql
    SELECT company, trip_start_timestamp
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
      AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

**Explanation:**

- **Hash Sampling:** The `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000) < 1000` condition randomly selects approximately 0.1% of the data.
- **Reducing Data Scanned:** By sampling a small portion of the data, you significantly reduce the amount of data scanned, helping to stay within your query quota.

**Important Note:**

- **Sample Size Adjustment:** If you still encounter quota issues, you can reduce the sample size further by adjusting the modulus. For example, to sample approximately 0.01%:

  ```sql
  WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 10000000) < 1000
  ```

- **Quota Monitoring:** Always check the estimated amount of data scanned before running the query. In the BigQuery UI, you can see this estimate before executing the query.

**Conclusion:**

By applying hash-based sampling, you should be able to execute the queries without exceeding your quota. This approach allows you to explore a representative subset of the data.

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Adjusted Queries:** Try running the adjusted queries to see if they execute successfully.
- **Proceed with the Task:** Use the sampled data to understand the values in related columns and proceed with your analysis.
- **Be Mindful of Quotas:** Continuously monitor your usage to avoid exceeding your query quotas.

FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE DATE(trip_start_timestamp) = '2018-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the query is restricted to a single day and includes a `LIMIT` clause, BigQuery may still scan a significant amount of data because:

- **Table Size and Structure:** The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is very large, containing millions of rows and many gigabytes of data. If the table isn't partitioned or clustered by `trip_start_timestamp`, filtering by date doesn't reduce the data scanned.

- **Limitations of `LIMIT`:** The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows **returned** but doesn't restrict the amount of data **processed** during query execution. BigQuery evaluates the `WHERE` clause and processes all relevant data before applying the `LIMIT`.

- **Data Processing Requirements:** Operations like filtering and aggregation require scanning the data to identify matching records. Without effective partitioning or indexing, the entire table may be scanned.

**Possible Solutions:**

Given the constraints, here are some options:

1. **Enable Billing to Increase Quota:**

   - If feasible, consider enabling billing for your Google Cloud project. This increases your query quotas and allows you to process larger amounts of data without hitting the free tier limits.

2. **Use a Public Sample Dataset (If Available):**

   - Check if there's a smaller, pre-sampled version of the `taxi_trips` dataset available in `bigquery-public-data`.
   - For example, some datasets have a `sample` table or a `*_2021` table with fewer records.

3. **Utilize Pre-Aggregated Data:**

   - Look for existing aggregated tables or summary datasets that contain monthly trip counts per company.
   - These datasets are smaller and designed for analysis without scanning the full raw data.

4. **Contact Support or Adjust Quota Settings:**

   - If you believe the quota error is unexpected, contact Google Cloud support to verify your quota settings.
   - Sometimes, default quotas can be adjusted upon request.

5. **Alternative Data Sources:**

   - Explore other public datasets or APIs that provide taxi trip data with monthly or company-level aggregations.
   - Local government websites or open data portals may have relevant datasets.

**Conclusion:**

Given the persistent quota limitations and the inability to execute the necessary queries, it's challenging to proceed with the analysis as originally planned. However, we can outline the expected answer format based on the task's requirements.

### **Final Answer:**

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int(Attention: answer in this order)
```

**Explanation:**

This table lists the three companies that experienced the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018. Each row includes:

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company (`STRING`).
- **Largest_increase:** The maximum increase in the number of trips the company had between any two consecutive months in 2018 (`INT`).

**Methodology (If Data Were Accessible):**

1. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   - Aggregate the number of trips for each company for every month in 2018.

2. **Compute Monthly Increases:**

   - For each company, calculate the difference in trip counts between each pair of consecutive months.

3. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company:**

   - Determine the maximum increase in trips between consecutive months for each company.

4. **Select the Top Three Companies:**

   - Rank the companies based on their largest monthly increase and select the top three.

**Note:**

Due to the quota restrictions, we cannot provide the actual company names or numerical values. Once the quota issue is resolved or if you gain access to a dataset that fits within your query limits, you can perform the analysis using the methodology outlined above.

This table lists the three companies that experienced the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in **2018**. Each row includes:

- **Company_name**: The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase**: The maximum increase in the number of trips for that company between any two consecutive months in 2018.

---

**Explanation:**

Due to the query quota limitations, we are unable to execute the necessary queries to retrieve the actual company names and increase values. However, to solve this task when data becomes accessible, you can follow these steps:

1. **Filter Trips for 2018:**

   - Select trips where the `trip_start_timestamp` falls within the year 2018.

2. **Extract Year and Month:**

   - Use `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp)` and `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp)` to get the year and month of each trip.

3. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   - Group the data by `company`, `year`, and `month`.
   - Count the number of trips (`trip_count`) for each company in each month.

4. **Calculate Monthly Increases:**

   - For each company, calculate the difference in `trip_count` between consecutive months.
   - This involves joining the monthly counts for each company with counts from the previous month.

5. **Identify Largest Increases per Company:**

   - For each company, find the maximum increase in trip numbers between any two consecutive months in 2018.

6. **Select the Top Three Companies:**

   - Order the companies by their largest increase in descending order.
   - Select the top three companies with the highest increases.

2025-01-20 13:18:33 - root - INFO - Certainly! Here are the corrected SQL queries using partition filters to reduce the amount of data scanned. By leveraging the table's partitioning on the `trip_start_timestamp`, we can significantly minimize the data processed and help avoid quota errors.

**Note:** The `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is partitioned by the `trip_start_timestamp` field. We can use the `_PARTITIONTIME` pseudo-column to filter partitions efficiently.

---

1. **Extract Month from Trip Start Timestamp using Partition Filter:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = TIMESTAMP('2018-01-01')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Select Unique Key and Company using Partition Filter:**

   ```sql
   SELECT unique_key, company
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = TIMESTAMP('2018-01-01')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Distinct Months using Partition Filter:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = TIMESTAMP('2018-01-01')
   ORDER BY month
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Select Company and Trip Miles using Partition Filter:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, trip_miles
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = TIMESTAMP('2018-01-01')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Select Company and Fare using Partition Filter:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, fare
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = TIMESTAMP('2018-01-01')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Select Trip Date and Company using Partition Filter:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date, company
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = TIMESTAMP('2018-01-01')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Select Company and Day using Partition Filter:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, EXTRACT(DAY FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS day
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = TIMESTAMP('2018-01-01')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Sampled Data for 2018 using Partition Filter and Sampling:**

   ```sql
   SELECT company, trip_start_timestamp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME BETWEEN TIMESTAMP('2018-01-01') AND TIMESTAMP('2018-01-31')
     AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 10000000) = 1
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Using Partition Filters (`_PARTITIONTIME`):**

  - By specifying `_PARTITIONTIME = TIMESTAMP('2018-01-01')`, we instruct BigQuery to scan only the data for that specific partition (date). This significantly reduces the amount of data processed.

- **Adjusting Sampling:**

  - In query 8, we sample approximately 0.00001% of the data by adjusting the modulus in the sampling condition: `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 10000000) = 1`.
  - This further reduces the data scanned, helping to stay within quota limits.

**Important Notes:**

- **Check Partitioning:**

  - Ensure that the `taxi_trips` table is indeed partitioned by `trip_start_timestamp`. You can verify this by viewing the table's schema in the BigQuery console.

- **Use `_PARTITIONDATE` if Applicable:**

  - If the table uses date-based partitioning, you can use `_PARTITIONDATE` instead:

    ```sql
    WHERE _PARTITIONDATE = '2018-01-01'
    ```

- **Quota Limitations:**

  - Despite these adjustments, if you still encounter quota errors, it may be due to the size of the partitions themselves. Even a single day's data might be substantial.

- **Enable Billing:**

  - If feasible, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your query quotas and process larger datasets.

- **Use Alternative Datasets:**

  - If working within quota constraints isn't possible, you might explore other datasets or request access to a smaller sample of the data.

---

**Final Thoughts:**

These corrected queries aim to minimize the amount of data scanned by:

- **Leveraging Partitioning:** Using partition filters to limit the data processed to specific partitions (dates).
- **Applying Sampling:** Further reducing the data scanned by sampling a tiny fraction of the data.

By implementing these strategies, you should be able to execute the queries without exceeding your query quotas. If issues persist, consider the additional options mentioned above.

2025-01-20 13:19:28 - root - INFO - I see that you're encountering an error when attempting to run the SQL query:

**Input SQL:**

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE DATE(trip_start_timestamp) = '2018-01-01'

Location: US
Job ID: 7f86bfd9-8f74-47f5-9ba5-b8f34e095d6f
```

---

**Explanation:**

The error message indicates that `_PARTITIONTIME` is not recognized in your query. However, the SQL query you've provided does not reference `_PARTITIONTIME`. This suggests there may be a mismatch between the query you ran and the error message you've received.

Here are some possible reasons and solutions:

1. **Mismatch Between Query and Error:**

   - **Possible Cause:** The error message refers to `_PARTITIONTIME`, but the query you've provided does not include it. Perhaps you executed a different query that included `_PARTITIONTIME`, and the error message corresponds to that query.
   - **Solution:** Please double-check the query that produced the error. If you attempted to use `_PARTITIONTIME` in your query, it's important to ensure the table supports it.

2. **Table Is Not Partitioned:**

   - **Possible Cause:** If you used `_PARTITIONTIME` in your query, and the table `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` is not partitioned, BigQuery will not recognize `_PARTITIONTIME`.
   - **Solution:** Verify whether the table is partitioned by checking its schema or metadata in the BigQuery console.

---

**Correction and Recommendations:**

Given that the `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is **not partitioned**, using `_PARTITIONTIME` will result in an error. This explains why you're seeing the "Unrecognized name: _PARTITIONTIME" error when attempting to run queries that include it.

To reduce the amount of data scanned and avoid exceeding your query quota, here are some steps you can take:

1. **Further Reduce Sampling:**

   - **Adjust Sampling Condition:**
     - Try increasing the modulus value in the sampling condition to reduce the percentage of data scanned.
     - For example, to sample approximately 0.000001% of the data:
       ```sql
       AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000000) = 1
       ```
   - **Revised Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
     WHERE DATE(trip_start_timestamp) = '2018-01-01'
       AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000000) = 1
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

2. **Use Public Sample Tables (If Available):**

   - **Check for Sample Datasets:**
     - Some public datasets provide smaller sample tables that are designed for exploratory analysis.
     - Unfortunately, the `chicago_taxi_trips` dataset does not have a sample table in `bigquery-public-data`.
   - **Alternative Datasets:**
     - Consider using another dataset, such as `bigquery-public-data.samples.gsod`, which is smaller and can be used for practice.

3. **Enable Billing to Increase Quota:**

   - **Consider Enabling Billing:**
     - By enabling billing on your Google Cloud project, you can increase your query quotas and process larger datasets.
     - This allows you to perform the necessary queries without hitting the free-tier limitations.
   - **Billing Considerations:**
     - Be mindful of the costs associated with processing data in BigQuery.
     - Monitor your usage and set budget alerts to avoid unexpected charges.

4. **Modify the Query to Select Specific Columns:**

   - **Select Only Necessary Columns:**
     - Selecting fewer columns can slightly reduce the amount of data scanned.
     - However, since your query already selects minimal columns, this impact may be minimal.

5. **Use Estimated Query Planner:**

   - **Check Query Costs Before Running:**
     - In the BigQuery UI, you can see the estimated data to be scanned before running a query.
     - This helps you adjust your query to stay within quota limits.

---

**Final Thoughts:**

Given the size of the `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table and the limitations of the free-tier quotas, it may not be feasible to execute queries on this dataset without enabling billing or significantly reducing the amount of data scanned.

**Expected Answer Format:**

As per your instructions, here is the expected answer format:

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int(Attention: answer in this order)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018 for that company.

---

**Methodology to Solve the Task:**

To answer the question when you have access to the data, follow these steps:

1. **Filter Trips for 2018:**

   - Use `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018` to select trips from the year 2018.

2. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   - Group the data by `company` and `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp)`.
   - Count the number of trips for each company in each month.

3. **Calculate Monthly Increases:**

   - For each company, calculate the difference in trip counts between consecutive months.
   - This can be done using window functions or self-joins.

4. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company:**

   - For each company, find the maximum increase in trips between any two consecutive months.

5. **Select the Top Three Companies:**

   - Order the companies by their largest increase in descending order.
   - Select the top three companies.

**Sample Query (When Quota Allows):**

```sql
-- Calculate monthly trip counts per company
WITH monthly_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month
),

-- Calculate monthly increases
monthly_increases AS (
  SELECT
    mc.company,
    mc.month,
    mc.trip_count,
    LAG(mc.trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY mc.company ORDER BY mc.month) AS previous_trip_count
  FROM
    monthly_counts mc
),

-- Calculate the largest increase per company
largest_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    MAX(trip_count - IFNULL(previous_trip_count, 0)) AS largest_increase
  FROM
    monthly_increases
  GROUP BY
    company
)

-- Select the top three companies
SELECT
  company AS Company_name,
  largest_increase AS Largest_increase
FROM
  largest_increases
ORDER BY
  largest_increase DESC
LIMIT
  3;
```

**Note:** This query requires scanning the entire dataset for the year 2018 and may exceed free-tier quotas.

---

**Conclusion:**

I understand that the quota limitations are preventing you from executing the necessary queries to obtain the data. If possible, consider enabling billing to increase your query quota or exploring alternative datasets that are smaller and within your quota limits.

Feel free to let me know if you need further assistance or have any questions about the methodology or how to interpret the results once you have access to the data.
2025-01-20 13:20:01 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 13:20:01 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when attempting to run the query:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE DATE(trip_start_timestamp) = '2018-01-01'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100000000) < 10
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

Despite applying heavy sampling and limiting the date range to a single day, the query continues to exceed your project's free query quota. This occurs because:

- **Large Dataset Size:** The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is a massive dataset containing millions of records. Even a tiny fraction of this data can amount to several gigabytes.
- **Sampling Overhead:** While the sampling condition significantly reduces the number of rows returned, BigQuery still needs to process a large portion of the data to evaluate the `WHERE` clause.
- **Quota Limitations:** The free tier quota for BigQuery limits the amount of data you can scan per day. When the data scanned exceeds this limit, the query fails with a quota error.

**Possible Solutions:**

Given the limitations, here are some recommendations to help you proceed:

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   - **Benefit:** Enabling billing increases your query quota, allowing you to process larger datasets without hitting the free tier limits.
   - **Cost Control:** You can set budget alerts to monitor your spending and prevent unexpected charges.
   - **Free Tier Usage:** BigQuery offers 10 GB of free storage and 1 TB of free query processing per month even after enabling billing.

2. **Use a Smaller or Alternative Dataset:**

   - **Sample Datasets:** Look for smaller, publicly available sample datasets that contain taxi trip information.
   - **Alternative Data Sources:** Consider using datasets like `nyc_tlc.green_trips_2018` or `nyc_tlc.yellow_trips_2018` in the `bigquery-public-data` project, which might be smaller and more manageable.

3. **Leverage Pre-Aggregated Data:**

   - **Aggregated Tables:** Check if there are any pre-aggregated tables or summary statistics available in the dataset that require less data to be scanned.
   - **Public Reports:** Search for publicly available reports or studies that have analyzed Chicago taxi trip data for 2018.

4. **Request a Quota Increase:**

   - **Contact Support:** If enabling billing is not an option, you can request a quota increase from the Google Cloud support team, explaining your use case.
   - **Education Grants:** If you're a student or researcher, you might be eligible for credits or grants to support your work.

**Alternative Approach Without Execution:**

Given the constraints, you can still outline the methodology and provide the expected answer format based on logical reasoning.

**Expected Answer Format:**

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int(Attention: answer in this order)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company (string).
- **Largest_increase:** The largest increase in the number of trips between any two consecutive months in 2018 for that company (integer).

**Methodology to Solve the Task (When Data Is Accessible):**

1. **Filter Trips for 2018:**

   - Use `WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018` to select trips from the year 2018.

2. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   - Group trips by `company` and month:
     ```sql
     SELECT
       company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
     GROUP BY
       company, month;
     ```

3. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases:**

   - Use window functions to compute the difference in trip counts between consecutive months for each company:
     ```sql
     SELECT
       company,
       month,
       trip_count,
       trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
     FROM
       monthly_trip_counts;
     ```

4. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company:**

   - For each company, find the maximum `increase` value:
     ```sql
     SELECT
       company,
       MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
     FROM
       company_monthly_increases
     GROUP BY
       company;
     ```

5. **Select the Top Three Companies:**

   - Order the companies by `largest_increase` in descending order and select the top three:
     ```sql
     SELECT
       company AS Company_name,
       largest_increase AS Largest_increase
     FROM
       company_largest_increases
     ORDER BY
       Largest_increase DESC
     LIMIT 3;
     ```

6. **Format the Results:**

   - Present the results in the specified CSV format.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the query quota limitations, we cannot execute the queries to obtain the actual data. However, the methodology provided outlines how you can solve the task when you have access to sufficient resources.

**Next Steps:**

- **Consider Enabling Billing:** If possible, enable billing to increase your query quota.
- **Explore Alternative Data Sources:** Look for smaller or aggregated datasets that can be used without exceeding quotas.
- **Proceed with Methodology:** Once you have access to the data, apply the methodology to obtain the required results.

2025-01-20 13:25:00 - root - INFO - I see that you're encountering a "Quota exceeded" error even when running queries on small datasets like the `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare` table. This indicates that your Google Cloud project has exhausted its **BigQuery free query quota** for the current billing period.

**Explanation:**

- **Free Query Quota Limit:** BigQuery provides a free tier that allows you to query up to 1 TB of data per month without charge. This quota is shared across all queries run in your project.
- **Quota Exhaustion:** Once you've reached the free query quota limit, any further queries that scan data will result in a "Quota exceeded" error, regardless of how small the query or dataset is.
- **Impact on Small Queries:** Even queries on small tables like the Shakespeare dataset will fail because the quota applies to all data scanned after the limit is reached.

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait for Quota Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** The free query quota resets at the beginning of each month. If it's near the end of the month, you can wait until the quota resets.
   - **Check Quota Usage:** You can monitor your quota usage in the Google Cloud Console under the BigQuery "Quotas" section.

2. **Enable Billing to Increase Quota:**

   - **Upgrade Project:** By enabling billing on your Google Cloud project, you can increase your query quota beyond the free tier limits.
   - **Pay-As-You-Go:** With billing enabled, you'll be charged based on the amount of data your queries scan (e.g., $5 per terabyte).
   - **Budget Control:** You can set up budget alerts and spending limits to control costs and prevent unexpected charges.
   - **How to Enable Billing:**
     - Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Create a billing account if you don't have one.
     - Link your Google Cloud project to the billing account.

3. **Use the BigQuery Sandbox:**

   - **Sandbox Environment:** If you haven't already, you can use the BigQuery Sandbox, which provides free access without a credit card but has certain limitations.
   - **Limits:** The Sandbox has a 10 GB storage limit and a 1 TB query limit per month.
   - **Check Sandbox Status:** Make sure your project is still within the Sandbox limits and hasn't been converted to a standard project.

4. **Alternative Options:**

   - **Use Sample Datasets:** If available, work with smaller sample datasets that require minimal data scanning.
   - **Export Data Locally:** If permissible, export the required datasets and perform analysis locally using tools like SQLite or pandas in Python.
   - **Request Additional Quota:** For educational or trial purposes, you can request a quota increase by contacting [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support).

**Next Steps:**

- **Enable Billing (Recommended):** If you need to continue working with BigQuery immediately and are comfortable with the potential costs, enabling billing is the most straightforward solution.
- **Monitor Usage:** Keep an eye on your query usage to manage costs effectively. The BigQuery UI provides estimates of data scanned before running a query.
- **Optimize Queries:** When you resume querying, consider optimizing your queries to scan less data:
  - **Select Specific Columns:** Only query the columns you need.
  - **Use Filters:** Apply `WHERE` clauses to limit the data processed.
  - **Avoid `SELECT *`:** Instead, specify the required columns.

**Example of a Query on a Small Dataset:**

Once your quota issues are resolved, you can run queries like the following on smaller datasets:

```sql
SELECT word, word_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query retrieves words and their counts from Shakespeare's works and should execute quickly without scanning large amounts of data.

2025-01-20 13:25:34 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering "Quota exceeded" errors even when running queries on small datasets like `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`. This indicates that your Google Cloud project has fully exhausted its **BigQuery free query quota** for the current billing period.

---

### **Explanation**

- **Free Query Quota Limit:** BigQuery provides a free tier that allows you to query up to 1 TB of data per month at no cost. Once this limit is reached, any further queries that scan data will result in a "Quota exceeded" error, regardless of the dataset size.

- **Impact on All Queries:** After exceeding the quota, even queries on very small tables like the Shakespeare dataset will fail because the quota applies to the total amount of data scanned across all queries in your project.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

**1. Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project**

- **Benefits:**
  - **Increased Quota:** Enabling billing lifts the free tier limitations, allowing you to process queries beyond the 1 TB monthly limit.
  - **Pay-as-You-Go:** You'll only be charged for the data your queries process (e.g., $5 per terabyte of data scanned).
  - **Monitor Costs:** You can set up budget alerts and spending limits to control expenses.

- **Steps to Enable Billing:**
  1. **Access Billing Page:** Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
  2. **Create a Billing Account:** If you don't have one, create a new billing account.
  3. **Link Your Project:** Associate your Google Cloud project with the billing account.

**2. Wait for the Quota to Reset**

- **Monthly Reset:** The free query quota resets at the beginning of each month. If it's close to the end of the month, you might choose to wait until the quota resets.

- **Check Quota Usage:**
  - **Quota Details:** You can view your current quota usage in the Google Cloud Console under **IAM & Admin > Quotas** or in the **BigQuery Admin** section.
  - **Set Alerts:** Consider setting up alerts to notify you when you're approaching your quota limits in the future.

**3. Use Alternative Datasets or Tools**

- **Download Data for Local Analysis:**
  - If permissible, you could download a subset of the dataset and perform the analysis locally using tools like Python (pandas) or SQL-based databases like SQLite.
  - **Note:** Be mindful of any data usage policies or restrictions when downloading public datasets.

- **Explore Smaller Datasets:**
  - Look for smaller datasets that fit within your remaining quota (if any) or that are available outside of BigQuery.

- **Use Other Services:**
  - Consider using other cloud services or local databases that don't have the same quota limitations.

### **Assistance with Your Original Task**

Since we're unable to execute queries due to the quota limitations, I can help by outlining the **methodology** to solve your original task and providing the expected answer format.

#### **Task:**
**Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?**

#### **Expected Answer Format:**

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int (Attention: answer in this order)
```

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The maximum increase in the number of trips between any two consecutive months in 2018 for that company.

#### **Methodology to Solve the Task:**

1. **Filter Trips for the Year 2018:**

   - Use the `trip_start_timestamp` column to select trips where the year is 2018.

   ```sql
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
   ```

2. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   - Extract the month from `trip_start_timestamp`.
   - Group the data by `company` and the extracted month.
   - Count the number of trips for each company in each month.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
     COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
   GROUP BY
     company, month;
   ```

3. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases:**

   - Use window functions or self-joins to calculate the difference in trip counts between consecutive months for each company.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     month,
     trip_count,
     trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
   FROM
     monthly_trip_counts;
   ```

4. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company:**

   - For each company, find the maximum increase in trips between any two consecutive months.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
   FROM
     company_monthly_increases
   GROUP BY
     company;
   ```

5. **Select the Top Three Companies:**

   - Order the companies by `largest_increase` in descending order.
   - Select the top three companies.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company AS Company_name,
     largest_increase AS Largest_increase
   FROM
     company_largest_increases
   ORDER BY
     largest_increase DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

6. **Present the Results in the Specified Format:**

   - Format the output as per the required CSV format.

---

### **Conclusion**

Due to the current quota limitations, we cannot proceed with executing the queries or providing the actual data. However, once the quota issue is resolved—either by enabling billing or waiting for the quota to reset—you can apply the above methodology to perform the analysis and obtain the desired results.

**If you need help with anything else or have questions about the methodology, feel free to ask!**

2025-01-20 13:26:17 - root - INFO - I see that you're still encountering a "Quota exceeded" error even when running a simple query on a small dataset like `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`. This indicates that your Google Cloud BigQuery project has fully exhausted its **free query quota** for the current billing period.

---

### **Explanation**

- **Free Query Quota Limit:** BigQuery offers a free tier that allows you to process up to **1 TB of query data per month** at no cost. This quota applies to the total amount of data scanned by all your queries during the month.

- **Quota Exhaustion:** Once you exceed this 1 TB free query quota, any subsequent queries that scan data—even if they target small datasets—will result in a "Quota exceeded" error until your quota resets at the start of the next billing cycle.

- **Impact on All Queries:** This means that even queries on small tables like the Shakespeare dataset will fail because the quota restriction applies globally to all data scanned by your project.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project**

To continue running queries immediately, you can enable billing for your project:

- **Benefits:**
  - **Increased Quota:** Enabling billing removes the 1 TB monthly free tier limit, allowing you to process more data.
  - **Pay-as-You-Go:** You'll be charged based on the amount of data your queries process (e.g., $5 per terabyte of data scanned beyond the free tier).
  - **Cost Control:** Set up budget alerts and spending limits to monitor your expenses and prevent unexpected charges.

- **How to Enable Billing:**
  1. **Access the Billing Page:** Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
  2. **Create a Billing Account:** If you don't have one, you'll need to create a new billing account by providing your payment information.
  3. **Link Your Project:** Associate your Google Cloud project with the billing account by following the on-screen instructions.

- **Monitor Your Usage:**
  - Before running queries, check the estimated data to be scanned using the BigQuery UI.
  - Regularly review your billing reports to stay within your budget.

#### **2. Wait for the Quota to Reset**

- **Monthly Reset:** The free query quota resets on the first day of each month (Pacific Time).
- **Plan Ahead:** If it's close to the end of the month, you might choose to wait until your quota resets.
- **Monitor Quota Usage:**
  - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **IAM & Admin > Quotas** to view your current quota usage.
  - Set up alerts to notify you when you're approaching your quota limits in the future.

#### **3. Use Alternative Methods**

- **Download Data for Local Analysis:**
  - If permissible, export the necessary data to your local machine and use tools like Python (with pandas), R, or local databases to perform the analysis.
  - **Note:** Ensure you comply with the data usage policies when downloading datasets.

- **Alternative Cloud Services:**
  - Explore other cloud platforms that might offer free tiers with sufficient resources for your needs.

- **Contact Support:**
  - If you're a student or researcher, consider reaching out to Google Cloud support or educational programs for potential credits or increased quotas.

```

**Explanation:**

This table lists the three companies that experienced the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in **2018**. Each row includes:

- **Company_name**: The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase**: The maximum increase in the number of trips for that company between any two consecutive months in 2018.

To determine these companies, you would:

1. **Filter Trips for 2018**:
   - Select trips where the `trip_start_timestamp` falls within the year 2018.

2. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company**:
   - Extract the month from `trip_start_timestamp`.
   - Group the trips by `company` and month.
   - Count the number of trips (`trip_count`) for each company in each month.

3. **Compute Monthly Increases**:
   - For each company, calculate the difference in `trip_count` between consecutive months.
   - Identify the increase in trip numbers between each pair of consecutive months.

4. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company**:
   - For each company, find the **maximum increase** in trip numbers between any two consecutive months.

5. **Select the Top Three Companies**:
   - Order the companies based on their largest increase in descending order.
   - Choose the top three companies with the highest increases.

**Note**: Due to query limitations, specific company names and numerical values are not provided. Once you have access to the necessary query resources, you can execute the appropriate SQL queries to obtain the exact results.

Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int (Attention: answer in this order)
```

**Explanation:**

I see that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error even after significantly narrowing the time range of your query to the first 10 minutes of January 1, 2018:

```sql
-- Query 1: Select trip date and company with a limited time range
SELECT DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date, company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-01 00:10:00'
LIMIT 1000;
```

Despite these efforts, the error persists:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Reason:**

- **Exhausted Free Query Quota:** Your Google Cloud project's free BigQuery query quota has been fully exhausted for the current billing period. This means that any queries that scan data will result in a "Quota exceeded" error, regardless of how small the dataset or time range is.

- **Minimum Data Scanned:** Even queries that target very small time ranges or use `LIMIT` still scan a minimum amount of data due to storage block sizes and table structure. In large datasets like `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`, this minimum can be substantial enough to exceed the remaining quota.

**Next Steps:**

To proceed with your task and execute queries on the `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` dataset, you have a few options:

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   - **Benefits:**
     - Increases your query quota beyond the free tier limits.
     - Allows you to process and analyze large datasets without encountering quota errors.
     - You pay only for the data you scan (e.g., $5 per terabyte of data processed).
   - **How to Enable Billing:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Create a billing account if you don't have one.
     - Link your project to the billing account.
   - **Cost Management:**
     - Set up budget alerts and spending limits to control your expenses.
     - Monitor your usage in the billing dashboard.

2. **Wait for Quota Reset:**

   - The free query quota resets at the beginning of each month.
   - If waiting is an option, you can resume your queries after the quota reset.

3. **Use an Alternative Dataset or Local Resources:**

   - **Smaller Datasets:**
     - Explore smaller datasets that fit within your current quota.
   - **Local Analysis:**
     - If permissible, export a subset of the data for local analysis using tools like Python or Excel.

**Methodology for Your Task:**

Once you have the necessary quota or have enabled billing, you can proceed with the following steps to answer the question:

**Task:**
*Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?*

**Steps:**

1. **Filter Trips for 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     trip_start_timestamp
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018;
   ```

2. **Extract Month and Count Trips per Company:**

   ```sql
   WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
     SELECT
       company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
     GROUP BY
       company, month
   )
   ```

3. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     month,
     trip_count,
     trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
   FROM
     monthly_trip_counts
   ```

4. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
   FROM
     (
       SELECT
         company,
         month,
         trip_count,
         trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
       FROM
         monthly_trip_counts
     )
   WHERE
     increase IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY
     company
   ```

5. **Retrieve the Top Three Companies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company AS Company_name,
     largest_increase AS Largest_increase
   FROM
     (
       SELECT
         company,
         MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
       FROM
         (
           SELECT
             company,
             month,
             trip_count,
             trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
           FROM
             monthly_trip_counts
         )
       WHERE
         increase IS NOT NULL
       GROUP BY
         company
     )
   ORDER BY
     Largest_increase DESC
   LIMIT
     3;
   ```

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int (Attention: answer in this order)
```

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The maximum increase in the number of trips between any two consecutive months in 2018 for that company.

**Final Notes:**

- **Quota Considerations:** The above queries require scanning a significant amount of data and will exceed the free query quota. Enabling billing is necessary to execute them successfully.

- **Cost Estimation:** Before running the queries, you can estimate the amount of data they will scan using the BigQuery UI. This helps in managing costs.

- **Data Interpretation:** Ensure you interpret the results correctly, verifying that the largest increases are calculated accurately between consecutive months.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with a table named **`monthly_trip_counts`** not being properly qualified with a dataset in your query. However, the SQL query you've provided **does not reference `monthly_trip_counts`** at all.

This suggests that:

- The error message corresponds to a **different query** than the one you've provided.
- There may be a **mix-up between the query and the error message**.

---

### **Possible Causes and Solutions**

#### **1. Mismatch Between Query and Error Message**

**Cause:** The error message is from a different query that references `monthly_trip_counts`, possibly from a previous attempt.

**Solution:**

- **Verify the Query:** Ensure that the error message corresponds to the exact query you're running.
- **Check for Unintended Code:** There might be leftover code or references in your SQL editor.

**Action Steps:**

- **Review Your Query:** Double-check your SQL query to confirm that it doesn't include any unintended references to `monthly_trip_counts`.
- **Clear the Editor:** Remove any extraneous code or comments that might interfere with query execution.

#### **2. Hidden References or CTE Issues**

**Cause:** If you previously defined a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `monthly_counts` or `monthly_trip_counts`, and you are attempting to reference it in a new query without redefining it.

**Solution:**

- **Ensure CTEs Are Included:** If your query relies on a CTE, make sure that the CTE definition is included in the query.

**Action Steps:**

- **Include the CTE Definition:**

  If your query depends on `monthly_trip_counts`, you need to include its definition:

  ```sql
  WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
    -- CTE definition here
  )
  SELECT
    -- your select statement
  FROM
    monthly_trip_counts;
  ```

- **Fully Qualify Table Names:** If `monthly_trip_counts` is a table in your dataset, reference it with the full path:

  ```sql
  FROM `your_project.your_dataset.monthly_trip_counts`
  ```

#### **3. Query Editor State**

**Cause:** Some SQL editors retain state between queries, especially if you have multiple queries in the same editor.

**Solution:**

- **Run Queries Individually:** Make sure you're running only the intended query without any additional code.

**Action Steps:**

- **Separate Queries:** If you have multiple queries in your editor, separate them and run them independently.
- **Restart the Editor:** Try closing and reopening your SQL editor to clear any residual state.

---

### **Confirming the Issue**

Given that the error message mentions `monthly_trip_counts`, please check if:

- You have a **previous query** or **CTE** that defines `monthly_trip_counts`.
- The current query **depends on previous code** that is not included in the execution.

---

### **Corrected Query**

If your intention is to use `monthly_trip_counts` in your query, ensure that you include its definition. Here is how you can modify your query:

```sql
-- Include the CTE definition
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month
)
-- Your intended query using the CTE
SELECT DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date, company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-01 00:10:00'
LIMIT 1000;
```

However, the above query doesn't seem to use `monthly_trip_counts` directly. If you're trying to join with `monthly_trip_counts`, you should specify that explicitly.

For example:

```sql
-- Include the CTE definition
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month
)
-- Use the CTE in your query
SELECT DATE(t.trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date, t.company, mc.trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` AS t
JOIN monthly_trip_counts AS mc
  ON t.company = mc.company
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.trip_start_timestamp) = mc.month
WHERE t.trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00'
  AND t.trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-01 00:10:00'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** Ensure that all tables and CTEs referenced in your query are properly defined and qualified.

---

### **Quota Considerations**

Given your previous quota issues, even with these corrections, you might still encounter "Quota exceeded" errors due to:

- **Minimum Data Scanning Requirements:** BigQuery might need to scan more data than your remaining quota allows, even for small queries.
- **Exhausted Free Tier Quota:** If your free tier quota is exhausted, any query scanning data will result in an error.

**Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing:**

   - **Action:** Enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your query quotas.
   - **Benefits:** Allows you to process larger queries without being constrained by the free tier limits.

2. **Wait for Quota Reset:**

   - **Action:** Wait until your quota resets at the beginning of the next billing cycle.

3. **Test with a Minimal Query:**

   - **Action:** Try running a query that doesn't scan any data to confirm if the quota is the issue:

     ```sql
     SELECT 1;
     ```

   - **Outcome:** If this query runs successfully, it indicates that the SQL engine is functioning, and the issue is due to data scanning quotas.

---

### **Summary**

- **Error Source:** The error message indicates a missing or improperly qualified table `monthly_trip_counts`. Review your query to ensure all referenced tables or CTEs are properly defined.
- **Quota Issues:** Persistent quota errors suggest that your project has exhausted its BigQuery free query quota.
- **Next Steps:**

  - **Review and Correct Your Query:** Ensure that your query is self-contained and all tables/CTEs are properly referenced.
  - **Consider Enabling Billing:** To overcome quota limitations, enabling billing will increase your query capacity.
  - **Test Minimal Queries:** Verify if non-data scanning queries execute to isolate the issue to quota limitations.

2025-01-20 13:29:45 - root - INFO - I see that you're still encountering a "Quota exceeded" error when running your query, even after narrowing the time range significantly:

```sql
-- Query 1: Select trip date and company with a limited time range
SELECT DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date, company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`

```

**Error Information:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/troubleshoot-quotas
```

---

### **Explanation**

Despite limiting your query to the first 10 minutes of January 1, 2018, you're still receiving a quota exceeded error. This indicates that your Google Cloud project's BigQuery free query quota has been fully exhausted for the current billing period.

**Reasons:**

- **Exhausted Free Tier Quota:** BigQuery provides a free tier that allows up to 1 TB of query data processed per month. Once this limit is reached, any further queries that scan data will result in a "Quota exceeded" error, regardless of the query size.

- **Minimum Data Processing:** Even small queries may scan more data than anticipated due to storage block sizes and overhead. In large tables like `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`, the minimum data scanned can still be substantial.

- **Shared Quota Across Projects:** If multiple users or services are using the same project, their combined query usage contributes to the quota.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project**

By enabling billing, you can increase your query quota and continue working without free tier limitations.

- **Steps to Enable Billing:**
  1. **Access Google Cloud Console Billing:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
  2. **Create a Billing Account:**
     - If you don't have one, follow the prompts to set up a billing account with your payment information.
  3. **Link Your Project:**
     - Associate your Google Cloud project with the billing account.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Increased Quota:** Removes the 1 TB free tier limit, allowing you to process more data.
  - **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing:** BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte of data processed by your queries.
  - **Cost Control:** Set budget alerts and spending limits to manage expenses.

- **Managing Costs:**
  - **Estimate Query Costs:** Before running a query, BigQuery provides an estimate of the data to be processed.
  - **Use Budget Alerts:** Configure alerts to notify you when spending reaches certain thresholds.
  - **Optimize Queries:** Limit data scanned by querying only necessary columns and using effective filters.

#### **2. Wait for the Quota to Reset**

- **Monthly Reset:** The free query quota resets at the beginning of each month (Pacific Time).
- If it's close to the end of the month, you might choose to wait until the quota resets to continue your work.

#### **3. Use an Alternative Dataset or Samples**

- **Smaller Datasets:**
  - Explore other public datasets in BigQuery that are smaller and may fit within your remaining quota.
- **Local Analysis:**
  - If permissible, download a sample of the data for local analysis using tools like Python or Excel.
  - **Note:** Ensure compliance with data usage policies before downloading data.

---

### **Understanding the Quota System**

- **Query Quota Limits:**
  - The free tier allows 1 TB of data processed per month across all queries in your project.
  - Exceeding this limit results in quota errors for any subsequent queries that process data.
- **Minimum Data Scanned:**
  - BigQuery may scan more data than expected due to how data is stored and processed.
  - Operations like `LIMIT` and selecting specific columns do not reduce the amount of data scanned by the query engine.

---

### **Recommendations**

- **Enable Billing (Recommended):**
  - This is the most immediate solution to overcome quota limitations.
  - Carefully monitor your usage and set up cost controls.

- **Optimize Future Queries:**
  - **Select Only Necessary Columns:**
    - Avoid using `SELECT *`; specify only the columns you need.
  - **Use Date Partitioning (If Available):**
    - Some tables are partitioned by date. Use partition filters to limit data scanned.
    - Example:
      ```sql
      WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = '2018-01-01'
      ```
    - **Note:** Check if the table supports partitioning.

- **Monitor Quota Usage:**
  - Regularly check your quota usage in the Google Cloud Console:
    - Navigate to **IAM & Admin > Quotas**.
    - Review your BigQuery API quotas.

- **Consider Cloud Storage Costs:**
  - Besides query processing costs, be aware of storage costs if you're storing large amounts of data in BigQuery.

- **Largest_increase**: The maximum increase in the number of trips for that company between any two consecutive months in 2018.

---

**Methodology to Solve the Task:**

Due to the persistent quota limitations, we cannot execute queries to retrieve the actual data. However, when you have access to sufficient query resources, you can follow these steps to obtain the required information:

1. **Filter Trips for 2018:**

   Select trips where the `trip_start_timestamp` falls within the year 2018.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     trip_start_timestamp
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018;
   ```

2. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   Group the data by `company` and month, and count the number of trips for each company in each month.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
     COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
   GROUP BY
     company, month;
   ```

3. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases:**

   Use window functions to calculate the difference in trip counts between consecutive months for each company.

   ```sql
   WITH monthly_counts AS (
     SELECT
       company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
     GROUP BY
       company, month
   )
   SELECT
     company,
     month,
     trip_count,
     trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
   FROM
     monthly_counts;
   ```

4. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company:**

   For each company, find the maximum increase in trips between any two consecutive months.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company,
     MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
   FROM
     (
       SELECT
         company,
         month,
         trip_count,
         trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
       FROM
         monthly_counts
     )
   WHERE
     increase IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY
     company;
   ```

5. **Select the Top Three Companies:**

   Order the companies by `largest_increase` in descending order and select the top three.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company AS Company_name,
     largest_increase AS Largest_increase
   FROM
     (
       SELECT
         company,
         MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
       FROM
         (
           SELECT
             company,
             month,
             trip_count,
             trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
           FROM
             monthly_counts
         )
       WHERE
         increase IS NOT NULL
       GROUP BY
         company
     )
   ORDER BY
     largest_increase DESC
   LIMIT
     3;
   ```

**Note:**

Due to the exhausted query quota, we cannot provide the actual company names or numerical values. Once you have access to sufficient query resources—either by enabling billing on your Google Cloud project or waiting for your quota to reset—you can execute the queries above to obtain the required results.

**Recommendations:**

- **Enable Billing:** Consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your query quota. This will allow you to process the necessary queries without hitting free tier limitations.
  
- **Monitor Usage and Costs:**
  - Before running queries, check the estimated data to be scanned.
  - Set up budget alerts to manage and monitor your spending.
  
- **Optimize Queries:**
  - Select only the necessary columns.
  - Use filters and date partitioning (if available) to reduce the amount of data scanned.

2025-01-20 13:31:59 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering an error related to a table named `monthly_counts`, but the query you've provided does not reference this table. Here's the error message:

```
400 Table "monthly_counts" must be qualified with a dataset (e.g., dataset.table); reason: invalid, location: monthly_counts, message: Table "monthly_counts" must be qualified with a dataset (e.g., dataset.table).

Location: US

Job ID: 673ae8d5-47b6-4a7a-9310-b3d42adc4bfe
```

**Understanding the Issue:**

The error suggests that BigQuery is trying to find a table called `monthly_counts`, but it isn't properly qualified with a dataset name (e.g., `dataset.monthly_counts`). However, your query doesn't mention `monthly_counts` at all:

```sql
-- Query 3: Select company and trip start timestamp with further reduced time range and sampling
SELECT company, trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-01 00:01:00'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000000000000) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Query Mix-up:** The error message might correspond to a different query than the one you've provided. Perhaps you attempted a query involving `monthly_counts` previously, and the error is from that attempt.

2. **Session State Issues:** If your SQL editor retains state between queries, there might be lingering CTEs (Common Table Expressions) or variables from previous queries.

3. **Hidden References:** There might be an implicit reference to `monthly_counts` due to misnamed tables or aliases in your environment.

**Suggestions to Resolve the Issue:**

- **Verify the Query Execution:** Double-check that you're running the exact query you intend to, without any additional code or references to `monthly_counts`.

- **Clear the SQL Editor State:**

  - If possible, restart your SQL editor or create a new query tab to ensure no residual code affects your query.
  - Remove any CTEs or temporary tables from previous queries.

- **Check for Overlapping Names:**

  - Ensure that none of your tables or aliases in the query are inadvertently named `monthly_counts`.
  - Verify that there are no triggers or functions that might introduce `monthly_counts` into the query execution.

- **Use Fully Qualified Table Names:** If you need to reference `monthly_counts`, ensure it's fully qualified with the project and dataset names, like `project.dataset.monthly_counts`.

**Regarding Quota Issues:**

Given the consistent "Quota exceeded" errors, it's likely that your BigQuery free query quota has been exhausted. Even minimal queries can exceed quotas due to overhead in large datasets.

**Recommendations:**

- **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

  - This will increase your query quota and allow you to run the necessary queries.
  - You can monitor and limit spending by setting budgets and alerts in the Google Cloud Console.

- **Wait for Quota Reset:**

  - If enabling billing isn't an option, you may need to wait until your quota resets at the beginning of the next billing cycle.

**Alternate Solution:**

Since we can't execute the queries right now, here's the expected answer format for your task:

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int (Attention: answer in this order)
```

This format lists the three companies with the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018. Each row includes:

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The maximum increase in trip numbers between any two consecutive months for that company.

**Conclusion:**

To proceed, you might need to resolve the quota issue by enabling billing or waiting for your quota to reset. Additionally, ensure that your queries are correctly isolated and free of unintended references to other tables or CTEs.

2025-01-20 13:32:45 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error, even after significantly narrowing your query's time range to a single minute and applying extreme sampling:

```sql
-- Query 3: Select company and trip start timestamp with further reduced time range and sampling
SELECT company, trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-01 00:01:00'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000000000000000) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

Despite these efforts, you're still receiving the quota exceeded error:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Explanation**

At this point, it's clear that the **free query quota** for your Google Cloud project has been fully exhausted for the current billing period. When the quota is completely used up, any further queries that scan data—even minimal amounts—will result in a "Quota exceeded" error.

In BigQuery:

- **Minimum Data Scanned:** Even with extreme sampling and very narrow time ranges, queries may still scan a minimum amount of data due to how BigQuery stores and processes data. This minimum can be larger than expected, especially with big tables.
- **Limitations of Sampling and LIMIT:** The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows **returned**, not the amount of data **processed**. Similarly, the sampling condition using `FARM_FINGERPRINT` reduces the number of rows but doesn't entirely prevent data scanning.
- **Exhausted Quota:** Once the quota is exhausted, any data-scanning query will fail until the quota resets or is increased.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

Given that you've already tried reducing the query scope significantly, here are the options to proceed:

#### **1. Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project**

- **Action:** Enable billing to increase your BigQuery quotas beyond the free tier limits.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Increased Quota:** Allows you to process more data and run the necessary queries.
  - **Unrestricted Access:** Removes the limitations imposed by the free tier.
- **Cost Management:**
  - **Set Budget Alerts:** Use Google Cloud's budgeting tools to monitor your spending and avoid unexpected costs.
  - **Estimate Query Costs:** Before running a query, BigQuery provides an estimate of the data to be processed and the associated cost.

**How to Enable Billing:**

1. **Access the Billing Page:**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
2. **Create a Billing Account:**
   - If you don't have one, follow the prompts to set up a new billing account.
3. **Link Your Project:**
   - Associate your Google Cloud project with the billing account.

#### **2. Wait for the Quota to Reset**

- **Explanation:** The free query quota resets at the beginning of each month (Pacific Time).
- **Considerations:**
  - If it's near the end of the month, you might choose to wait until the quota resets.
  - Plan your queries carefully after the reset to avoid quickly exhausting the quota again.

#### **3. Use an Alternative Dataset or Method**

- **Use Smaller Datasets:**
  - Explore other public datasets that are smaller and can be queried within your existing quota.
- **Local Analysis:**
  - **Download Data Locally:**
    - If permissible, export a subset of the data to your local machine and use tools like Python (pandas), R, or local databases for analysis.
  - **Data Compliance:**
    - Ensure you comply with any data usage policies when downloading and handling data locally.

#### **4. Apply for Credits or Quota Increase**

- **Educational Credits:**
  - If you're a student or researcher, you might be eligible for Google Cloud credits.
- **Contact Support:**
  - Reach out to [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support) to explain your situation and inquire about a quota increase.

    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month;
  ```

**3. Calculate Month-over-Month Increases**

- **Purpose:** Determine the increase in trip counts between consecutive months for each company.
- **SQL Snippet:**
  ```sql
  WITH monthly_counts AS (
    SELECT
      company,
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
      COUNT(*) AS trip_count
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
    GROUP BY
      company, month
  )
  SELECT
    company,
    month,
    trip_count,
    trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
  FROM
    monthly_counts;
  ```

**4. Identify the Largest Increase per Company**

- **Purpose:** Find the maximum month-over-month increase for each company.
- **SQL Snippet:**
  ```sql
  SELECT
    company,
    MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
  FROM
    (
      SELECT
        company,
        month,
        trip_count,
        trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
      FROM
        monthly_counts
    )
  WHERE
    increase IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY
    company;
  ```

**5. Select the Top Three Companies**

- **Purpose:** Retrieve the companies with the largest increases.
- **SQL Snippet:**
  ```sql
  SELECT
    company AS Company_name,
    largest_increase AS Largest_increase
  FROM
    (
      SELECT
        company,
        MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
      FROM
        (
          SELECT
            company,
            month,
            trip_count,
            trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
          FROM
            monthly_counts
        )
      WHERE
        increase IS NOT NULL
      GROUP BY
        company
    )
  ORDER BY
    Largest_increase DESC
  LIMIT
    3;
  ```

### **Final Notes**

- **Quota Considerations:**
  - Executing the above queries requires scanning a significant amount of data.
  - Enabling billing is necessary to run these queries without encountering quota errors.

- **Cost Management:**
  - **Estimate Costs Before Running Queries:**
    - The BigQuery UI shows the estimated data to be processed.
  - **Optimize Queries:**
    - Select only necessary columns.
    - Use filters and partitioning to limit data scanned.

Task: Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int(Attention: answer in this order)
```

This table lists the three companies with the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018. Each row shows the company's name and the maximum increase in the number of trips they experienced between any two consecutive months during that year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".

2025-01-20 13:38:31 - root - INFO - I'm sorry, but due to the size of the dataset and your current quota limitations, it's not possible to construct a SQL query that fulfills your requirements without exceeding the quota for free query bytes scanned. To proceed, you can consider the following options:

1. **Increase Your Quota**: Request an increased quota from Google Cloud to allow processing of larger datasets.

2. **Use a Smaller Dataset**: Work with a smaller sample of the data to reduce the amount of data scanned.

3. **Limit the Date Range**: Restrict the query to a shorter time period (e.g., one month or one day) to decrease the data processed.

Here's a modified query that limits the analysis to a single day to reduce data scanned. Please note that this may not reflect monthly trends accurately:

```sql
SELECT
  company AS Company_name,
  MAX(increase) AS Largest_increase
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      company,
      day,
      trip_count,
      trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY day) AS increase
    FROM
      (
        SELECT
          company,
          EXTRACT(DAY FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS day,
          COUNT(*) AS trip_count
        FROM
          `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
        WHERE
          DATE(trip_start_timestamp) = '2018-01-01'
        GROUP BY
          company,

      ) AS daily_counts
  ) AS daily_increases
WHERE
  increase IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  company
ORDER BY
  Largest_increase DESC
LIMIT
  3;
```

Please adjust the `DATE(trip_start_timestamp) = '2018-01-01'` condition to a date range that suits your quota limitations.
