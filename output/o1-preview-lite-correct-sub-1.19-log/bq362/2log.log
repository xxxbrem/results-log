2025-01-20 13:09:37 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering a **quota exceeded** error because the query is scanning more data than allowed by your project's free tier limits in BigQuery. The `taxi_trips` table is quite large, and querying it without sufficient filters can exceed the free query quota.

To reduce the amount of data scanned and avoid the quota limit, you can limit your query to a smaller subset of the data. For example, you can filter the data to a specific date range or sample of records. Here's how you can adjust your query:

```sql
-- List distinct taxi companies for trips in January 2018
SELECT DISTINCT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

By adding a `WHERE` clause that filters trips to a specific month (e.g., January 2018), the amount of data scanned is significantly reduced, which should help avoid exceeding the query quota.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Limit the Date Range Further:** If the problem persists, you can narrow down the date range even more, such as filtering for a single day.

  ```sql
  -- List distinct taxi companies for trips on January 1, 2018
  SELECT DISTINCT company
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

- **Use Sampled Data:** Unfortunately, BigQuery doesn't support the `TABLESAMPLE` clause, but you can approximate sampling by using conditions that select a fraction of the data. For instance, filtering on a hash of a field:

  ```sql
  -- Approximate sampling by using MOD function on a hashed value
  SELECT DISTINCT company
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1  -- Adjust the modulus for sampling rate
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

- **Preview the Table:** If you're using the BigQuery web UI, you can use the **Preview** tab to view a small sample of the data without consuming your query quota.

**Understanding Quota Limits:**

- **Free Tier Quotas:** BigQuery's free tier allows up to 1 TB of query data processed per month. If you've exceeded this limit, you may receive quota errors.

- **Billing Account:** To increase your quota, you can set up a billing account in Google Cloud Platform. This allows you to pay for additional data processing beyond the free tier.

**Next Steps:**

- **Check Current Quota Usage:** Review your project's current BigQuery quota usage to confirm if you've exceeded the free tier limits.

- **Consider Using a Smaller Dataset:** If possible, use a smaller dataset or a subset of the table for your analyses.

If you continue to experience issues after trying these suggestions, please let me know, and we can explore other options.
2025-01-20 13:10:08 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 13:10:08 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the **quota exceeded** error when running your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
LIMIT 1000;
```

The error message indicates that your project has **exceeded the quota for free query bytes scanned**:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

This happens because BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the **total amount of data scanned during query execution**, not the number of rows returned by the query. Even though you're limiting the result to 1,000 rows, the query needs to scan the entire `company` column across all rows in the `taxi_trips` table to find all distinct values, which can be a significant amount of data.

The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is quite large, containing over a **billion rows**, and querying it without filters can easily exceed the free tier quota.

**Here's how you can address this issue:**

### 1. Reduce Data Scanned by Filtering on Partitioned Columns

The `taxi_trips` table is **partitioned by the `trip_start_timestamp`** column. By adding a filter on this column, you can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned because BigQuery will read only the partitions that satisfy the filter condition.

**Modify your query to include a date range filter:**

```sql
-- List distinct taxi companies for trips in January 2018
SELECT DISTINCT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query limits the data to trips that started in **January 2018**, reducing the data scanned to just that month's partition.

### 2. Narrow Down the Date Range Further

If you still encounter the quota error, narrow the date range even more. For example, filter for a single day:

```sql
-- List distinct taxi companies for trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT DISTINCT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;
```

### 3. Sample the Data to Reduce Data Scanned

Sampling the data can further reduce the amount of data scanned. While BigQuery doesn't support `TABLESAMPLE`, you can simulate sampling using a hash function on a field like `unique_key`.

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of the data for trips in January 2018
SELECT DISTINCT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

Adjust the modulus (`100` in `MOD(..., 100)`) to change the sampling rate. For example, using `MOD(..., 1000) = 1` samples approximately 0.1% of the data.

### 4. Preview the Table Using the BigQuery UI

In the BigQuery web interface, you can **preview** the table, which displays a small subset of rows without consuming your query quota:

1. Go to the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).
2. Navigate to `bigquery-public-data` > `chicago_taxi_trips` > `taxi_trips`.
3. Click on the **Preview** tab to view a sample of the data.

### 5. Check Your Quota Usage and Limits

It's possible that your project has reached its **free tier quota limits** for the month. BigQuery's free tier allows up to **1 TB of data processed per month** for queries. If you've exceeded this limit, you will need to wait until the quota resets next month or enable billing.

**To check your quota usage:**

- Visit the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
- Filter the quotas for BigQuery to see your usage and limits.

### 6. Enable Billing to Increase Quota

If you need to process more data than the free tier allows, you can **enable billing** for your Google Cloud project:

1. Set up a billing account if you don't have one.
2. Link your project to the billing account.

Enabling billing allows you to process more data, but you'll be charged for the data scanned by your queries. Be cautious and monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.

### 7. Use Aggregated Public Datasets or Smaller Tables

Sometimes, working with aggregated datasets can help reduce data scanned. For example, if there's a table that contains aggregated trip counts per company and month, using that table would be more efficient.

---

**Example Adjusted Query:**

Here's an example of a query that counts trips per company for a specific month, which should scan less data:

```sql
-- Count trips per company in January 2018
SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Summary:**

- **Filter Using Partitioned Columns:** Always filter by `trip_start_timestamp` to reduce data scanned.
- **Sample the Data:** Use hashing functions like `FARM_FINGERPRINT` with `MOD` to sample a fraction of the data.
- **Check Quota Limits:** Ensure you haven't exceeded free tier quotas.
- **Enable Billing if Necessary:** Consider enabling billing to increase quotas but monitor usage carefully.
- **Use UI Preview:** Use the BigQuery UI to preview tables without consuming quota.

2025-01-20 13:11:09 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 13:11:09 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the **quota exceeded** error when running your query:

```sql
-- 1. List distinct taxi companies in the dataset.
SELECT DISTINCT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

#### **Understanding the Issue:**

- **Exceeded Free Query Quota:** The error indicates that your project has exceeded the free tier quota for query bytes scanned in BigQuery.
- **Large Dataset:** The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is substantial, containing over a **billion rows**. Queries scanning large amounts of data can quickly exceed the free quota.

#### **Possible Causes:**

1. **Quota Exhaustion:**
   - You've likely reached the **free monthly limit** (currently 1 TB of data processed per month) for query data processed in BigQuery.
   - Any additional queries that process data will result in a quota error until the quota resets next month.

2. **Query Scanning Too Much Data:**
   - Even simple queries like `SELECT DISTINCT` can scan large amounts of data because they need to read all rows in the specified column.

#### **Solutions:**

1. **Check Your Quota Usage:**

   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) to review your BigQuery quota usage.
   - Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas, particularly the **Free Tier** quotas for queries.

2. **Wait for Quota Reset:**

   - The free tier quotas reset monthly. You may need to wait until the next billing cycle to run more queries without incurring charges.

3. **Enable Billing:**

   - To continue running queries that exceed the free tier quota, consider **setting up a billing account**.
   - This allows you to pay for additional data processing beyond the free tier limits.
   - **Caution:** Be sure to monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.

4. **Reduce Data Scanned:**

   - Apply filters to your queries to limit the amount of data scanned.
   - **Example:** Filter by date to query a smaller partition of the dataset.

     ```sql
     -- List distinct taxi companies for trips in January 2018
     SELECT DISTINCT company
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
     WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
       AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   - **Note:** Even with filters, if the subset of data still exceeds your remaining quota, the error will persist.

5. **Use Smaller Datasets or Samples:**

   - Unfortunately, BigQuery doesn't support direct data sampling like `TABLESAMPLE`.
   - However, you can approximate sampling using a hash function:

     ```sql
     -- Approximate sampling by using MOD function on a hashed value
     SELECT DISTINCT company
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
     WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     - Adjust the modulus to change the sample size.
     - **Caution:** This method still may not reduce data scanned enough to stay within quota limits.

6. **Use the BigQuery Web UI Preview Feature:**

   - In the BigQuery console, navigate to the table and click on the **Preview** tab to view a small, pre-selected sample of data without affecting your quota.

#### **Proceeding Without Executing Queries:**

Since running queries isn't feasible due to quota limits, we can proceed conceptually to address your original task:

**Original Task:**

> *"Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018? This is an SQL task. Please provide the simplest possible answer format in `csv` format like a table and include a brief explanation."*

#### **Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  - `company`: The taxi company name.
  - `trip_start_timestamp`: Timestamp when the trip started.
    - Used to extract the year and month for grouping.
  - `unique_key`: Unique identifier for each trip.

#### **Conditions to Use:**

- **Year Filter:** Only include trips from the year 2018.
  - `WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018`

#### **Conceptual Steps to Solve the Task:**

1. **Aggregate Trip Counts by Company and Month:**

   - Count the number of trips per company for each month in 2018.

2. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases:**

   - For each company, calculate the difference in trip counts between consecutive months.

3. **Identify the Largest Increases:**

   - For each company, find the maximum increase between any two consecutive months.
   - Select the three companies with the highest such increases.

#### **SQL Queries (Conceptual Outline):**

Since we can't execute the queries, here's how they would conceptually look:

```sql
-- Step 1: Get trip counts per company per month in 2018
SELECT
  company,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
GROUP BY
  company, month;

-- Step 2: Calculate month-over-month increases
SELECT
  company,
  month,
  trip_count,
  LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_count,
  trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
FROM
  (/* Subquery from Step 1 */);

-- Step 3: Find the maximum increase per company
SELECT
  company,
  MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
FROM
  (/* Subquery from Step 2 */)
GROUP BY
  company;

-- Step 4: Retrieve the top 3 companies with the largest increases
SELECT
  company AS Company_name,
  largest_increase AS Largest_increase
FROM
  (/* Subquery from Step 3 */)
ORDER BY
  largest_increase DESC
LIMIT
  3;
```

#### **Answer Format:**

Following your requested format:

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int (Attention: answer in this order)
```

#### **Explanation:**

This table lists the **three companies** that experienced the **largest increase in trip numbers between any two consecutive months** in 2018. Each row includes:

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The maximum increase in the number of trips between two consecutive months for that company.

---

**Note:** Since we cannot run the queries due to quota limitations, we are unable to provide actual company names and increase values. The format above shows how the results would be structured based on the data.

#### **Moving Forward:**

- **Option 1: Enable Billing**

  - If obtaining the actual data is crucial, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project.
  - This will allow you to run the necessary queries, but be mindful of potential costs.

- **Option 2: Use Alternative Tools or Data Sources**

  - If enabling billing isn't an option, consider using other datasets or tools that fit within your available resources.

- **Option 3: Proceed with Theoretical Analysis**

  - Continue working conceptually, using the outlined queries and understanding of the data to complete your task.

2025-01-20 13:11:51 - root - INFO - It seems you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when attempting to run even simple queries on the `taxi_trips` table:

```sql

SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`

LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is a very large dataset, containing over **100 million records**. Even queries that seemingly retrieve a small number of rows (due to `LIMIT 1000`) can scan a significant amount of data because BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned.

When you filter data using a `WHERE` clause, BigQuery still needs to scan the entire column(s) specified in your query to determine which rows match the condition—unless the table is partitioned and/or clustered on the column(s) used in the `WHERE` clause.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

Since you're unable to run queries due to quota limitations, we can consider alternative approaches:

#### **1. Reduce Data Scanned with Partitioning**

- The `taxi_trips` table is **partitioned on the `trip_start_timestamp`** field.
- By adding a **date filter** that aligns with the partitioning, you can limit the amount of data scanned.

**Example: Query a Single Day**

```sql
-- Retrieve trip start timestamps for trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This significantly reduces the amount of data scanned because only the partition for that specific day is accessed.

#### **2. Use a Sampling Technique**

- **Approximate sampling** can help reduce data scanned.

**Example: Sample 0.1% of Data**

```sql
-- Sample approximately 0.1% of the data
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

- The `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1` condition selects approximately 0.1% of the data.

#### **3. Use the BigQuery Sandbox**

- If you're using the **BigQuery sandbox**, note that it has limitations, including a maximum amount of data that can be scanned per day.
- If you exceed these limits, you'll need to wait until the next day or consider enabling billing.

#### **4. Enable Billing for Your Project**

- **Enable billing** on your Google Cloud project to increase quota limits.
- This allows you to process more data, but be mindful of potential costs.
- You can set budgets and alerts to monitor usage.

#### **5. Utilize Public Aggregated Data**

- Look for **aggregated datasets** that already summarize the data you need.
- For example, there might be public tables or views that contain pre-calculated trip counts per company and month.

---

### **Alternative Approach to Your Task**

Given the constraints, we can proceed conceptually to address your original task:

**Task:**

> *Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?*

#### **Conceptual Steps to Solve the Task**

1. **Extract Monthly Trip Counts per Company**

   - Group trips by `company` and `month` to get monthly trip counts.
   - Use `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp)` to get the month.

2. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases**

   - For each company, calculate the difference in trip counts between consecutive months.
   - Use the `LAG` window function to get the trip count from the previous month.

3. **Identify the Largest Increases**

   - Determine the maximum increase for each company.
   - Select the top three companies with the highest increases.

#### **Sample SQL Query (Conceptual)**

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate monthly trip counts per company
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month
),

-- Step 2: Calculate month-over-month increases
monthly_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    month,
    trip_count,
    LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_count,
    trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
  FROM
    monthly_trip_counts
),

-- Step 3: Find the maximum increase per company
max_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
  FROM
    monthly_increases
  WHERE
    increase IS NOT NULL  -- Exclude NULL increases (first month)
  GROUP BY
    company
)

-- Step 4: Retrieve the top 3 companies with the largest increases
SELECT
  company AS Company_name,
  largest_increase AS Largest_increase
FROM
  max_increases
ORDER BY
  largest_increase DESC
LIMIT
  3;
```

**Note:** Since we cannot execute the query, we cannot provide actual data.

---

### **Final Answer Format**

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int (Attention: answer in this order)
```

**Explanation:**

This table lists the top three companies that experienced the largest increase in trip numbers between any two consecutive months in 2018. Each row includes:

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The largest increase in the number of trips the company had between two consecutive months.

---

### **Next Steps**

- **Enable Billing (If Possible):**

  - To run the queries and get actual results, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project.
  - This will lift the quota restrictions but will incur costs based on data processed.
  - You can monitor and control costs using budgets and alerts.

- **Use a Smaller Dataset:**

  - If enabling billing isn't an option, consider using a smaller dataset for analysis.
  - You might find or create a filtered dataset that contains a subset of the data for analysis.

- **Alternative Data Sources:**

  - Explore other public datasets or sources that might have pre-aggregated data.
  - Check if the City of Chicago's Open Data Portal provides relevant datasets that are smaller in size.

- **Local Analysis:**

  - If you can export a subset of the data (e.g., trips from a single day or week), you can perform the analysis locally using tools like Excel, Python, or R.

---

### **Summary**

- **Quota Limitations:** You're unable to run queries due to exceeding the free query bytes quota in BigQuery.

- **Conceptual Solution:** Provided a method and sample SQL queries to solve the task conceptually.

- **Answer Format:** Presented the expected CSV format for the final answer, as per your instructions.

- **Recommendations:** Suggested enabling billing, using smaller datasets, or alternative data sources to proceed.

2025-01-20 13:12:44 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the **quota exceeded** error when running your query:

```sql
-- Retrieve trip start timestamps for trips in 2018.
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

The error indicates that your query is scanning more data than your current BigQuery quota allows. BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned.

Even with a `LIMIT 1000`, the query must scan all data in the specified date range to retrieve the requested rows. Since the `taxi_trips` table is very large (billions of rows), scanning an entire year's data exceeds the free tier quota.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Reduce the Date Range Further**

To minimize data scanned, narrow the date range to a smaller period, such as a single day or even an hour.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Retrieve trip start timestamps for trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02 00:00:00'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This reduces the data scanned to a single day's partition.

#### **2. Use Data Sampling**

Sample a small fraction of the data to reduce the scanned volume.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Sample approximately 0.1% of data from January 2018
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

Adjust the modulus (`1000`) to change the sampling rate.

#### **3. Check Your Quota Usage**

It's possible you've exhausted your free query quota for the month (1 TB per month for the free tier). To check your usage:

- Go to the **Google Cloud Console**.
- Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Quotas**.
- Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.

#### **4. Enable Billing**

If you need to process more data:

- **Enable billing** for your project. This allows you to exceed free tier limits.
- Be cautious of potential costs. Monitor usage with budgets and alerts.

#### **5. Use the BigQuery Console Preview**

- In the BigQuery UI, navigate to the table.
- Click on the **Preview** tab to see sample data without affecting your quota.

### **Proceeding with the Original Task**

Given the constraints, let's address your original task conceptually.

**Task:**

*Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?*

---

### **Approach**

#### **1. Identify Relevant Data**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
- **Columns:**
  - `company`
  - `trip_start_timestamp`

#### **2. Filter Data for 2018**

- Include trips where `trip_start_timestamp` is within 2018.

#### **3. Calculate Monthly Trip Counts**

- Extract year and month from `trip_start_timestamp`.
- Group by `company` and `month`.
- Count trips per company per month.

#### **4. Calculate Month-over-Month Increases**

- For each company, calculate the difference in trip counts between consecutive months.
- Use the `LAG()` window function to get the previous month's trip count.

#### **5. Find Maximum Increase per Company**

- For each company, determine the largest month-over-month increase.

#### **6. Select Top Three Companies**

- Order companies by their maximum increase in descending order.
- Select the top three companies.

---

### **Conceptual SQL Query**

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate monthly trip counts per company
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month
),

-- Step 2: Calculate month-over-month increases
monthly_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    month,
    trip_count,
    LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_count,
    trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
  FROM
    monthly_trip_counts
),

-- Step 3: Find the maximum increase per company
max_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
  FROM
    monthly_increases
  WHERE
    increase IS NOT NULL  -- Exclude NULL values
  GROUP BY
    company
)

-- Step 4: Get the top 3 companies with the largest increases
SELECT
  company AS Company_name,
  largest_increase AS Largest_increase
FROM
  max_increases
ORDER BY
  largest_increase DESC
LIMIT
  3;
```

**Note:** Since we can't execute queries due to quota limitations, we cannot provide actual results.

---

### **Final Answer Format**

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int (Attention: answer in this order)
```

This table lists the three companies with the largest increase in trip numbers between any two consecutive months in 2018. Each row includes:

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The maximum increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months.

---

### **Next Steps**

#### **Option 1: Enable Billing**

- **Enable billing** on your Google Cloud project to run the queries.
- Carefully monitor usage to control costs.

#### **Option 2: Use a Smaller Dataset**

- Limit your analysis to a smaller date range (e.g., a single month or week).
- This reduces data scanned and may fit within your quota.

#### **Option 3: Proceed with Conceptual Understanding**

- Use the provided approach and SQL query as a template.
- Explain the methodology without executing the query.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Data Visualization Tools:** Consider using tools like Google Data Studio or Tableau with BigQuery connectors to visualize data without writing complex queries.

- **BigQuery Public Datasets Documentation:** Refer to the [BigQuery Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) documentation for information on dataset sizes and usage limits.

- **Monitor Query Size:** Use the BigQuery UI to estimate the amount of data your query will scan before running it.

2025-01-20 13:13:25 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 13:13:25 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the **quota exceeded** error when trying to run your query:

```sql
-- Retrieve trip start timestamps for trips in 2018.
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

The error indicates that your query is scanning more data than your BigQuery project's quota allows. BigQuery enforces quotas on the amount of data scanned per day, and even seemingly simple queries can exceed these limits when run against large datasets.

The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is **very large**, containing over **200 million rows** and several terabytes of data. When you run a query without sufficient filters, BigQuery needs to scan a large portion of the dataset, which can easily exceed the free tier quota.

**Key Points:**

- **Query Cost Isn't Affected by LIMIT:** The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows returned, **not** the amount of data scanned.
- **Data Scanned Depends on Columns and Filters:** The amount of data your query scans depends on the number of columns you select and the effectiveness of your filters.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Reduce the Date Range Further**

To minimize the data scanned, narrow your date range to a single day or even a few hours.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Retrieve trip start timestamps for trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Advantages:**

- **Partition Pruning:** The `taxi_trips` table is partitioned by `trip_start_timestamp`. Filtering on this column allows BigQuery to scan only the relevant partition, significantly reducing data scanned.

#### **2. Use Data Sampling**

Approximate data sampling by using a hash function on a unique field.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Sample approximately 0.1% of the data
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:**

- Adjust the modulus (`1000`) to change the sampling rate.
- This method can still scan a large amount of data; combining it with a date filter is recommended.

#### **3. Preview the Table Using the BigQuery UI**

- Use the **Preview** tab in the BigQuery web interface to view a small, random sample of the table without consuming your query quota.
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the `taxi_trips` table in the BigQuery console.
  2. Click on the **Preview** tab to see sample records.

#### **4. Check Your Quota Usage**

- It's possible that you've exceeded your project's **free query quota** for the month.
- **To Check Quotas:**
  - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
  - Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.
  - Review your usage against limits like **“Query usage per day”**.

#### **5. Enable Billing to Increase Quotas**

- **Enable billing** on your Google Cloud project to raise your quota limits.
- **Benefits:**
  - Access to higher quotas.
  - Ability to process more data.
- **Cautions:**
  - Be aware of potential costs. Monitor your usage and set up budgeting alerts.

---

### **Alternative Approach**

Given the quota limitations, we can proceed by outlining the steps to answer your original task without executing the queries.

#### **Original Task:**

> **Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?**

#### **Conceptual Solution:**

1. **Aggregate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   - Group trips by `company` and `month`.
   - Count the number of trips for each company per month.

2. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases:**

   - Use the `LAG()` window function to get the previous month's trip count for each company.
   - Calculate the difference between the current month and the previous month's trip counts.

3. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company:**

   - For each company, find the maximum month-over-month increase in trip counts.

4. **Select the Top Three Companies:**

   - Order the companies by their largest increase in descending order.
   - Select the top three companies.

#### **Sample SQL Query (Conceptual):**

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate monthly trip counts per company
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month
),

-- Step 2: Calculate month-over-month increases
monthly_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    month,
    trip_count,
    LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_count,
    trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
  FROM
    monthly_trip_counts
),

-- Step 3: Find the maximum increase per company
max_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
  FROM
    monthly_increases
  WHERE
    increase IS NOT NULL  -- Exclude NULL values where there is no previous month
  GROUP BY
    company
)

-- Step 4: Select the top three companies with the largest increases
SELECT
  company AS Company_name,
  largest_increase AS Largest_increase
FROM
  max_increases
ORDER BY
  largest_increase DESC
LIMIT
  3;
```

#### **Final Answer Format:**

As per your requested format:

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int (Attention: answer in this order)
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The maximum increase in trip numbers the company experienced between any two consecutive months in 2018.

Since we can't execute the query due to quota limitations, we cannot provide actual company names and increase values. However, this framework outlines how you would derive the required information.

---

### **Next Steps**

#### **Option 1: Enable Billing**

- **Action:** Enable billing on your Google Cloud project.
- **Benefits:**
  - Run queries without hitting the free tier quota limits.
  - Complete your analysis with actual data.
- **Considerations:**
  - Monitor your usage to avoid unexpected costs.
  - You can set up budget alerts in Google Cloud to track spending.

#### **Option 2: Use Alternative Data Sources**

- **Action:** Look for smaller datasets or summaries that contain the necessary information.
- **Examples:**
  - Public datasets with aggregated monthly trip counts.
  - Datasets provided by the City of Chicago's open data portal.

#### **Option 3: Simulate Data for Practice**

- **Action:** Create a small, simulated dataset locally to practice the analysis.
- **Benefits:**
  - Understand the process without needing to run queries on large datasets.
  - Prepare for working with actual data when resources allow.

2025-01-20 13:13:52 - root - INFO - It looks like there's a **syntax error** in your SQL query. The error message indicates an **unclosed string literal**:

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [4:53]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [4:53]
```

**Explanation of the Error:**

- In your SQL query, at line 4, there's a mismatched quotation mark.
- The closing quotation mark for the date `'2018-12-31'` is a backtick **\`** instead of a single quote **'**.

**Here's the problematic line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31`
```

- Note the backtick **\`** at the end of `'2018-12-31\`** instead of a closing single quote **'**.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- 3. Count the number of trips per company in 2018.
SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000;
```

- Changed the backtick **\`** to a single quote **'** at the end of `'2018-12-31'`.

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the corrected query.** This should resolve the syntax error.
- **Be mindful of Quota Limits:** Given previous **quota exceeded** errors when querying large datasets, the corrected query might still exceed your available quota.

**Tips to Avoid Quota Errors:**

- **Reduce the Date Range:** Narrow down the `trip_start_timestamp` range to a smaller period, such as a single month or day.

  ```sql
  WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31'
  ```

- **Sample the Data:** Use a sampling method to analyze a subset of the data.

  ```sql
  WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1
  ```

- **Preview Data:** Use the BigQuery UI's **Preview** tab to view a sample of the table without consuming your query quota.

FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31`
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation of the Issue:**

- The error indicates that your query is scanning more data than your BigQuery project's quota allows.
- The table `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` is **very large**, containing over **200 million rows**.
- **Even with a `LIMIT 1000` clause**, BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned.
- Scanning data for the entire year of 2018 requires processing a significant amount of data, which exceeds the free tier quota.

**Suggestions to Resolve the Issue:**

### 1. **Correct Syntax Errors**

Before addressing the quota issue, ensure there are no syntax errors in your query.

- In your `WHERE` clause, the closing quote for `'2018-12-31'` is a backtick **\`** instead of a single quote **'**.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
-- 3. Count the number of trips per company in 2018.
SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000
```

### 2. **Reduce the Date Range**

Limit your query to a smaller date range to reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Example: Query a Single Day**

```sql
-- Count the number of trips per company on January 1, 2018.
SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000
```

- **Benefits:**
  - Since the table is partitioned by `trip_start_timestamp`, filtering on this column allows BigQuery to scan only the relevant partition, significantly reducing data scanned.

### 3. **Sample the Data**

Use a sampling method to analyze a subset of the data.

**Example: Approximate Sampling**

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of the data from January 2018.
SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 1
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1  -- Adjust modulus for sampling rate
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000
```

- **Note:** Adjust the modulus in `MOD` to change the sampling rate.

### 4. **Check Your Quota Usage**

It's possible that you've exhausted your project's free query quota for the month.

- **To Check Quotas:**
  - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
  - Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.
  - Review your usage against the limits.

### 5. **Enable Billing to Increase Quotas**

If you need to process more data than the free tier allows, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project.

- **Steps:**
  - Set up a billing account if you don't have one.
  - Link your project to the billing account.
- **Cautions:**
  - Be mindful of potential costs.
  - Use budgeting and alerts to monitor and control your spending.

### 6. **Use the BigQuery UI Preview Feature**

- Use the **Preview** tab in BigQuery Console to view a small sample of the data without consuming your query quota.

---

**Proceeding with Your Original Task:**

Given the constraints, executing the query to obtain actual results isn't feasible due to quota limitations. However, I can guide you through the conceptual steps to solve your task.

**Task:**

> *Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?*

**Conceptual Solution:**

1. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company:**

   - Group trips by `company` and `month`.
   - Use `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp)` to extract the month.
  
   ```sql
   WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
     SELECT
       company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
     GROUP BY
       company, month
   ),
   ```

2. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases:**

   - Use the `LAG()` window function to access the previous month's trip count for each company.
   - Calculate the increase by subtracting the previous month's count from the current month's count.
  
   ```sql
   monthly_increases AS (
     SELECT
       company,
       month,
       trip_count,
       LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_count,
       trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
     FROM
       monthly_trip_counts
   ),
   ```

3. **Find the Maximum Increase per Company:**

   - For each company, identify the largest increase in trip counts between any two consecutive months.
  
   ```sql
   max_increases AS (
     SELECT
       company,
       MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
     FROM
       monthly_increases
     WHERE
       increase IS NOT NULL  -- Exclude NULL values where there is no previous month
     GROUP BY
       company
   )
   ```

4. **Select the Top Three Companies with the Largest Increases:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     company AS Company_name,
     largest_increase AS Largest_increase
   FROM
     max_increases
   ORDER BY
     largest_increase DESC
   LIMIT
     3;
   ```

**Note:** This is a conceptual query outline. Executing it requires processing data beyond your current quota limits.

**Expected Answer Format:**

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int (Attention: answer in this order)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The maximum increase in the number of trips the company experienced between any two consecutive months in 2018.

---

**Conclusion:**

- Due to quota limitations, we're unable to execute the query and provide actual results.
- **Options to Proceed:**
  - **Enable Billing:** Allows you to run the necessary queries but may incur costs.
  - **Limit Data Scanned:** Adjust queries to scan less data, though this may not suffice if quotas are exhausted.
  - **Use Alternative Data Sources:** Look for smaller datasets or pre-aggregated data that fit within your quota.
  - **Proceed Conceptually:** Understand and document the methodology without executing the queries.

2025-01-20 13:16:16 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 13:16:16 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the **quota exceeded** error when trying to run your query:

```sql
-- 3. Count the number of trips per company in 2018.
SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31`
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

#### **1. Syntax Error**

Before addressing the quota issue, there's a **syntax error** in your SQL query:

- The closing quote for `'2018-12-31'` in your `WHERE` clause is a backtick **`** instead of a single quote **'**.

**Incorrect Line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31`
```

**Corrected Line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
```

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
-- 3. Count the number of trips per company in 2018.
SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **2. Quota Exceeded Issue**

Even after fixing the syntax error, you're likely to **still encounter the quota exceeded error** because:

- The `taxi_trips` table is very large, containing **hundreds of millions of rows**.
- BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned.
- **Filtering for an entire year** scans a significant amount of data, exceeding the free tier query quota.

---

### **Solutions to Resolve the Quota Issue**

#### **Option 1: Reduce Data Scanned by Limiting the Date Range**

To minimize the data scanned and stay within quota limits, restrict your query to a smaller date range.

**Example: Query Trips for a Single Day**

```sql
-- Count the number of trips per company on January 1, 2018.
SELECT
  company,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE
  trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY
  company
LIMIT
  1000;
```

**Benefits:**

- The `taxi_trips` table is **partitioned** by `trip_start_timestamp`.
- By restricting the date range to a single day, BigQuery scans only the relevant partition, significantly reducing data scanned.

#### **Option 2: Sample the Data**

You can sample a fraction of the data to reduce the amount scanned.

**Example: Approximate Sampling Using Hash Function**

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of trips in 2018
SELECT
  company,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1  -- Adjust the modulus for sampling rate
GROUP BY
  company
LIMIT
  1000;
```

**Notes:**

- The `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1` condition selects approximately 1% of the data.
- Adjust the modulus value (`100`) to change the sampling rate.

#### **Option 3: Check Your BigQuery Quota Usage**

It's possible that you've **exceeded your free query quota** for the month:

- BigQuery's free tier allows up to **1 TB of data processed per month**.
- To check your quota usage:

  1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
  2. Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.
  3. Review your usage and limits.

#### **Option 4: Enable Billing to Increase Quota**

If you need to process more data:

- **Enable billing** on your Google Cloud project.
- **Benefits:**

  - Increases your query quota.
  - Allows you to process more data.

- **Cautions:**

  - Be mindful of potential costs.
  - Set up budget alerts to monitor spending.

#### **Option 5: Use the BigQuery UI's Preview Feature**

- In the BigQuery console, navigate to the `taxi_trips` table.
- Click on the **Preview** tab to view a sample of the data without consuming your query quota.

---

### **Proceeding with Your Original Task**

Given the quota limitations, we can proceed conceptually to address your task.

#### **Task:**

**Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?**

#### **Approach:**

**1. Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company**

- Group trips by `company` and `month`.
- Use `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp)` to extract the month.
- Count the number of trips for each company per month.

**2. Calculate Month-over-Month Increases**

- Use the `LAG()` window function to get the previous month's trip count for each company.
- Calculate the increase by subtracting the previous month's trip count from the current month's count.

**3. Identify the Maximum Increase per Company**

- For each company, find the maximum month-over-month increase.

**4. Select the Top 3 Companies**

- Order the companies by their maximum increase in descending order.
- Select the top three companies.

#### **Conceptual SQL Query**

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate monthly trip counts per company
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month
),

-- Step 2: Calculate month-over-month increases
monthly_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    month,
    trip_count,
    LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_count,
    trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
  FROM
    monthly_trip_counts
),

-- Step 3: Find the maximum increase per company
max_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
  FROM
    monthly_increases
  WHERE
    increase IS NOT NULL  -- Exclude NULL values where there is no previous month
  GROUP BY
    company
)

-- Step 4: Select the top three companies with the largest increases
SELECT
  company AS Company_name,
  largest_increase AS Largest_increase
FROM
  max_increases
ORDER BY
  largest_increase DESC
LIMIT
  3;
```

**Note:** Executing this query may still exceed your quota due to the volume of data involved.

---

### **Final Answer Format**

As per your instructions, here's the expected format:

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int
```

**Explanation:**

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018 for that company.

---

### **Next Steps**

#### **Option 1: Enable Billing**

- **Action:** Enable billing on your Google Cloud project to run the full query without quota restrictions.
- **Benefits:**

  - Allows you to process large datasets.
  - Provides access to BigQuery's full capabilities.

- **Considerations:**

  - Monitor your usage to control costs.
  - Set budgets and alerts in the Google Cloud Console.

#### **Option 2: Limit Data Scanned**

- **Action:** Modify your query to analyze a smaller subset of data.

**Example: Analyze a Specific Quarter**

```sql
-- Modify the query to focus on the first quarter of 2018
WHERE
  trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-03-31'
```

- **Benefits:**

  - Reduces the amount of data scanned.
  - May allow you to stay within your current quota.

#### **Option 3: Use Pre-Aggregated Data**

- **Action:** Look for pre-aggregated datasets or summaries that require less data processing.
- **Sources:**

  - Public datasets with monthly trip counts per company.
  - Reports or datasets from the City of Chicago's open data portal.

#### **Option 4: Proceed Conceptually**

- **Action:** If executing the query isn't possible, explain the methodology and reasoning based on the conceptual steps provided.

2025-01-20 13:17:01 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering the **quota exceeded** error when attempting to run your query:

```sql
-- 4. Extract year and month from trip start timestamps.
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

The error indicates that your query is scanning more data than your BigQuery project's quota allows. BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned.

Even though you're limiting the results to 1,000 rows with `LIMIT 1000`, the query must scan the entire `trip_start_timestamp` column across all rows in the `taxi_trips` table to extract the year and month for each record.

The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is quite large, containing over **200 million rows** and several terabytes of data. Running queries on such large datasets can quickly exceed the free tier quotas.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Reduce Data Scanned by Filtering on Partitioned Columns**

The `taxi_trips` table is **partitioned** on the `trip_start_timestamp` column. By filtering on this column, you can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned because BigQuery will only process the relevant partitions.

**Modify your query to include a date range filter:**

```sql
-- Extract year and month from trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;
```

By limiting the data to a single day (e.g., January 1, 2018), you reduce the amount of data scanned to that day's partition.

#### **2. Narrow Down the Date Range Further**

If scanning a single day still exceeds your quota, you can further restrict the time frame:

```sql
-- Extract year and month from trips between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM on January 1, 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-01 01:00:00'
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **3. Sample the Data to Reduce Data Scanned**

You can approximate data sampling using a hash function on a field like `unique_key`:

```sql
-- Sample approximately 0.1% of the data
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** Adjust the modulus (`1000` in this case) to change the sampling rate. A larger modulus results in a smaller sample.

#### **4. Check Your Quota Usage**

It's possible you've already **exceeded your free query quota** for the month. BigQuery's free tier allows up to **1 TB** of data processing per month.

- **To Check Your Quota Usage:**
  - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
  - Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.
  - Review your usage against the limits.

If you've exceeded your quota, you may need to wait until it resets next month or consider enabling billing.

#### **5. Enable Billing to Increase Quota**

If you need to process more data, you can **enable billing** for your Google Cloud project. This allows you to pay for additional data processing beyond the free tier limits.

- **Advantages:**
  - Access higher quotas.
  - Process larger datasets.
- **Considerations:**
  - Monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.
  - You can set budgets and alerts in the Google Cloud Console to control costs.

#### **6. Use the BigQuery UI's Preview Feature**

- In the BigQuery web interface:
  - Navigate to the `taxi_trips` table.
  - Click on the **Preview** tab to view a sample of the data without consuming your query quota.

---

### **Proceeding with Your Original Task**

Given the limitations, you might consider proceeding conceptually to achieve your task.

#### **Task Recap:**

- **Objective:** Generate 10 simple SQL queries to understand the values in related columns of the `taxi_trips` table.
- **Constraints:** You can only use tables in the provided list.

#### **Possible Queries with Reduced Data Scanning:**

Here are 10 modified queries that include filters to reduce data scanned:

```sql
-- 1. List distinct taxi companies for trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT DISTINCT company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. Retrieve trip start timestamps for trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT trip_start_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 3. Count the number of trips per company on January 1, 2018
SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000;

-- 4. Extract year and month from trip start timestamps on January 1, 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. Get the number of trips per hour on January 1, 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS hour,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY hour
LIMIT 1000;

-- 6. Retrieve trips with their start and end timestamps and company on January 1, 2018
SELECT trip_start_timestamp, trip_end_timestamp, company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 7. Get trips on January 1, 2018, with trip miles and company
SELECT trip_start_timestamp, trip_miles, company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 8. Find average trip miles per company on January 1, 2018
SELECT company, AVG(trip_miles) AS average_miles
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000;

-- 9. List trips on January 1, 2018, with fare, tips, and total cost
SELECT trip_start_timestamp, fare, tips, trip_total, company
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 10. Get distinct payment types used on January 1, 2018
SELECT DISTINCT payment_type
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** These queries include a date filter to limit the data scanned to a single day, which should help stay within your quota limits.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Estimate Query Size Before Running:**
  - In the BigQuery console, you can see an estimate of the data your query will scan. This helps you adjust your query before running it.
- **Use Clustering for Efficiency:**
  - If possible, use clustering fields to optimize data scanning. However, this may not be feasible with public datasets.
- **Monitor Your Quota Usage:**
  - Regularly check your quota usage to avoid hitting limits unexpectedly.

---

### **Summary**

- The **quota exceeded** error occurs because your query scans more data than allowed under your current BigQuery quota.
- By **filtering on partitioned columns** like `trip_start_timestamp`, you can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.
- Sampling the data or narrowing the date range further can also help you stay within your quota limits.
- If you consistently need to process large amounts of data, consider **enabling billing** for your project, but be cautious of potential costs.

```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/troubleshooting-errors at [2:1]
```

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

The error indicates that your query is scanning more data than your BigQuery project's quota allows. BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned by your query. Even with a `LIMIT 1000`, the query must process the `trip_start_timestamp` column for all rows in the table to extract the year and month.

The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is very large, containing hundreds of millions of rows and several terabytes of data. Running a query without sufficient filters can quickly exceed the free tier quota.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Reduce Data Scanned by Filtering on Partitioned Columns**

The `taxi_trips` table is **partitioned** on the `trip_start_timestamp` column. By adding a `WHERE` clause to filter on this column, you can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned because BigQuery will read only the partitions that satisfy the filter condition.

**Modify Your Query:**

Limit your query to a specific date or a smaller date range.

```sql
-- Extract year and month from trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query restricts data to trips that started on **January 1, 2018**, reducing the data scanned to just that day's partition.

#### **2. Narrow Down the Date Range Further**

If you still encounter the quota error, you can narrow the date range even more.

```sql
-- Extract year and month from trips between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM on January 1, 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-01 01:00:00'
LIMIT 1000;
```

By focusing on a single hour, you further reduce the amount of data scanned.

#### **3. Sample the Data Using a Hash Function**

If you need to query a random subset of the data, you can use a hash function to sample rows.

```sql
-- Sample approximately 0.1% of the data
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

Adjust the modulus (`1000` in this case) to change the sampling rate. This condition selects approximately 0.1% of the data.

#### **4. Check Your Free Tier Quota**

It's possible that you've reached your free tier quota for BigQuery. The free tier allows up to **1 TB** of data processing per month for queries. If you've exceeded this limit, you will need to wait until the quota resets next month or enable billing.

To check your BigQuery usage:

- Go to the [GCP Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
- Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.
- Review your usage and limits.

#### **5. Enable Billing to Increase Quota**

If you need to process more data than the free tier allows, consider enabling billing for your project:

1. **Set Up a Billing Account:** If you don't have one, create a billing account in the Google Cloud Console.

2. **Link Your Project to the Billing Account:** This will allow your project to use the billing account for charges.

3. **Monitor Costs:** Use budget alerts to monitor your spending and avoid unexpected charges.

**Note:** Enabling billing allows you to process more data but will incur charges based on the amount of data scanned by your queries.

#### **6. Use the BigQuery Web UI's Preview Feature**

If you need to quickly inspect the data without running a query:

1. **Navigate to the Table:**
   - Go to the BigQuery Console.
   - In the left pane, find the `bigquery-public-data` project.
   - Navigate to `chicago_taxi_trips` > `taxi_trips`.

2. **Use the Preview Tab:**
   - Click on the **Preview** tab to view a small sample of the data.
   - This does not consume your query quota.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Estimate Query Cost Before Running:**
  - In the BigQuery UI, you can see an **estimated query cost** before running the query.
  - This helps you understand how much data will be processed and whether it may exceed your quota.

- **Use Clustering (If Applicable):**
  - While not applicable to public datasets, clustering can help reduce data scanned in your own datasets.

- **Optimize Queries:**
  - Select only the necessary columns.
  - Apply filters that utilize partitioning and clustering.
  - Avoid using `SELECT *` when not needed.

---

### **Summary**

- **Reason for Error:** Your query scans more data than allowed under your project's quota because it processes the entire `trip_start_timestamp` column across all records in a large table.

- **Solution:** Modify your query to include a `WHERE` clause that filters on the `trip_start_timestamp` column, reducing the data scanned.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Adjust your query with appropriate filters.
  - Consider enabling billing if you need to process larger amounts of data.
  - Use the Preview feature for quick data inspection without consuming quota.

---

### **Example Adjusted Query**

Here's the adjusted query limiting data to a single day:

```sql
-- Extract year and month from trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;
```

2025-01-20 13:18:21 - root - INFO - I see that you're still encountering the **quota exceeded** error when running your query:

```sql
-- 4. Extract year and month from trip start timestamps.
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

The error indicates that your query is scanning more data than permitted under your current BigQuery quota. The `LIMIT` clause reduces the number of rows **returned** but does **not** limit the amount of data **scanned**. BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the **data scanned during query execution**, not the number of rows retrieved.

The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is substantial, containing over **200 million rows** and several terabytes of data. Without appropriate filters, even simple queries can exceed the free tier quota.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Limit the Date Range to Reduce Data Scanned**

Since the table is **partitioned** by `trip_start_timestamp`, filtering on this column significantly reduces the data scanned. Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
-- Extract year and month from trips on January 1, 2018.
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' 
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query restricts the data to a single day, which reduces the data scanned to that day's partition.

#### **2. Further Narrow the Time Frame**

If the error persists, narrow the time frame even more:

```sql
-- Extract year and month from trips between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM on January 1, 2018.
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00' 
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-01 01:00:00'
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **3. Use Approximate Data Sampling**

Sample a small fraction of the data to reduce the data scanned:

```sql
-- Sample approximately 0.1% of the data.
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 1000) = 1
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **4. Check Your Quota Usage**

It's possible that you've already reached your free tier quota for BigQuery. The free tier allows up to **1 TB** of data processing per month.

- **Check Quota Usage:**
  - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
  - Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.
  - Review your usage against the limits.

#### **5. Enable Billing to Increase Quota**

If you need to process more data:

- **Enable Billing:**
  - Set up a billing account in Google Cloud Platform.
  - Link your project to the billing account.

- **Benefits:**
  - Access higher quotas.
  - Ability to process larger datasets.

- **Considerations:**
  - Monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.
  - Set up budget alerts in the billing section.

---

### **Proceeding with Your Original Task**

Given the recurring quota issues, it might be challenging to execute queries that process the necessary data volume. However, I can help you conceptually to address your task:

**Task:**

> **Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?**

---

### **Conceptual Solution**

#### **Relevant Table and Columns**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
- **Columns:**
  - `company`: Name of the taxi company.
  - `trip_start_timestamp`: Timestamp when the trip started.

#### **Approach**

1. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company**

   - **Extract Year and Month:**
     - Use `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp)` and `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp)`.

   - **Filter for 2018:**
     - Include trips where the year is 2018.

   - **Group and Count:**
     - Group by `company` and `month`.
     - Count the number of trips per company per month.

2. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases**

   - **Use Window Functions:**
     - Utilize the `LAG()` function to get the previous month's trip count for each company.

   - **Calculate Increase:**
     - Compute the difference between the current month's trip count and the previous month's trip count.

3. **Identify the Largest Increase per Company**

   - **Maximum Increase:**
     - For each company, find the maximum month-over-month increase.

4. **Select the Top Three Companies**

   - **Order and Limit:**
     - Order the companies by their largest increase in descending order.
     - Select the top three companies.

---

### **Sample SQL Query (Conceptual)**

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate monthly trip counts per company
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month
),

-- Step 2: Calculate month-over-month increases
monthly_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    month,
    trip_count,
    LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_count,
    trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
  FROM
    monthly_trip_counts
),

-- Step 3: Find the maximum increase per company
max_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
  FROM
    monthly_increases
  WHERE
    increase IS NOT NULL  -- Exclude NULL values (first month per company)
  GROUP BY
    company
)

-- Step 4: Retrieve the top 3 companies with the largest increases
SELECT
  company AS Company_name,
  largest_increase AS Largest_increase
FROM
  max_increases
ORDER BY
  largest_increase DESC
LIMIT
  3;
```

**Note:** Executing this query may exceed your current quota due to the data volume involved.

---

### **Final Answer Format**

As per your requested format:

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int
```

---

### **Explanation**

This table would list the **three companies** that experienced the **largest increase in trip numbers between any two consecutive months** in 2018. Each row includes:

- **Company_name:** The name of the taxi company.
- **Largest_increase:** The maximum increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months.

---

### **Alternative Approaches**

#### **Option 1: Use Aggregated Data (If Available)**

- **Check for Pre-Aggregated Tables:**
  - There might be public datasets or tables that already contain aggregated monthly trip counts per company.
  - Using such datasets would significantly reduce data scanned.

#### **Option 2: Limit Analysis to a Smaller Dataset**

- **Focus on a Subset:**
  - Choose a few companies of interest.
  - Limit the date range further (e.g., analyze only the first quarter of 2018).

- **Modify the Query:**

  ```sql
  -- Example: Analyze trips for selected companies in January and February 2018
  WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
    SELECT
      company,
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
      COUNT(*) AS trip_count
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-03-01'
      AND company IN ('Company A', 'Company B', 'Company C')  -- Replace with actual company names
    GROUP BY
      company, month
  ),
  ...
  ```

#### **Option 3: Simulate Data Locally**

- **Create a Sample Dataset:**
  - Simulate a small dataset locally with hypothetical trip counts per company and month.
  - Use this dataset to perform the analysis and understand the methodology.

---

### **Recommendations**

- **Enable Billing (If Feasible):**
  - To execute queries on large datasets, consider enabling billing.
  - **Monitor Costs:** Set up budgets and alerts to keep track of expenses.

- **Use BigQuery Sandbox Limits:**
  - If you have remaining quota, ensure your queries are optimized to stay within limits.

- **Proceed Conceptually:**
  - If running the queries isn't possible, focus on understanding and explaining the steps involved.

2025-01-20 13:18:53 - root - INFO - It looks like there's a **syntax error** in your SQL query. The error message indicates an **unclosed string literal at [5:53]**. This usually happens when there's a mismatch in quotation marks in your query.

**Issue in Your Query:**

In your `WHERE` clause, the closing quote for `'2018-12-31'` is a backtick (**\`**) instead of a single quote (**'**).

**Incorrect Line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31`
```

**Corrected Line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- 5. Get the number of trips per month in 2018.
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
GROUP BY month
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

However, even after fixing the syntax error, you might encounter a **quota exceeded** error because querying the entire year of data can scan a large amount of data, possibly exceeding your BigQuery free tier quota.

**Suggestions to Resolve Quota Issues:**

1. **Limit the Date Range:**

   Narrow down the date range to reduce the amount of data scanned. For example, focus on a single month or a specific day.

   ```sql
   -- Get the number of trips per month for January 2018.
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
          COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-02-01'
   GROUP BY month
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Sample the Data:**

   Use a sampling method to analyze a subset of the data.

   ```sql
   -- Sample approximately 1% of the data for 2018.
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
          COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
     AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1  -- Adjust modulus for sampling rate
   GROUP BY month
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Use Partitioned Data:**

   The `taxi_trips` table is partitioned by `trip_start_timestamp`. By filtering on this column, you reduce the data scanned.

4. **Check Quota Usage:**

   Ensure you haven't exceeded your project's BigQuery free tier quota for the month. If you have, you might need to wait until it resets or consider enabling billing.

---

**Note:** Be cautious when running queries on large datasets. Always estimate the amount of data your query will scan to avoid exceeding quotas.

2025-01-20 13:19:41 - root - INFO - It looks like there's a **syntax error** in your SQL query, which might be causing issues in addition to the quota error. Specifically, in your `WHERE` clause, the closing quote for `'2018-12-31'` is a backtick **\`** instead of a single quote **'**.

**Incorrect line:**

LIMIT 1000;
```

---

However, even after fixing the syntax error, you may still encounter the **quota exceeded** error:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

### **Understanding the Quota Issue**

- **BigQuery Quotas:** BigQuery enforces quotas on the amount of data you can process for free. The free tier allows up to **1 TB of data processed per month**.
  
- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows **returned**, not the amount of data **scanned** by the query. Therefore, your query may still scan a large amount of data even if it returns few rows.

- **Large Dataset:** The `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table is very large, containing over **200 million rows** and several terabytes of data. Scanning all trips in 2018 exceeds the free tier quota.

### **Solutions to Resolve the Quota Issue**

#### **1. Reduce the Date Range**

Limit your query to a smaller date range to reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Example: Query a Single Month**

```sql
-- Get the number of trips per month in January 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
GROUP BY month
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Example: Query a Single Day**

```sql
-- Get the number of trips on January 1, 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS day,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY day
LIMIT 1000;
```

By narrowing the date range, you reduce the amount of data scanned, which helps to avoid exceeding your quota.

#### **2. Use Sampling to Reduce Data Scanned**

You can sample a fraction of the data to further reduce the data scanned.

**Example: Sample Approximately 1% of Data**

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of the data in 2018
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1  -- Adjust modulus for sampling rate
GROUP BY month
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1` selects approximately 1% of the data.
  - Adjust the modulus value (`100`) to change the sampling rate.

#### **3. Check Your Quota Usage**

It's possible you've reached your project's free query quota for the month.

- **To Check Quota Usage:**
  - Visit the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
  - Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.
  - Review your usage and limits.

#### **4. Enable Billing to Increase Quota**

If you need to process more data:

- **Enable Billing:**
  - Set up a billing account in Google Cloud Platform.
  - Link your project to the billing account.
- **Benefits:**
  - Higher data processing quotas.
  - Ability to process large datasets.
- **Considerations:**
  - Be mindful of costs; monitor usage to avoid unexpected charges.
  - Set up budget alerts in the Cloud Console.

#### **5. Use the BigQuery UI's Preview Feature**

- **Preview Data Without Consuming Quota:**
  - In the BigQuery Console, navigate to the `taxi_trips` table.
  - Click on the **Preview** tab to view a sample of the data.

### **Summary**

- **Syntax Correction:** Fix the unclosed string literal in your query by replacing the backtick with a single quote.
- **Quota Issue:** The query scans a large amount of data, exceeding your free tier quota.
- **Solutions:**
  - Reduce the date range to limit data scanned.
  - Use data sampling to analyze a subset of data.
  - Check your current quota usage.
  - Consider enabling billing for higher quotas.

2025-01-20 13:20:21 - root - INFO - It appears there's a **syntax error** in your SQL query due to an unclosed string literal. Specifically, in your `WHERE` clause, the closing quote for `'2018-12-31'` is a backtick (\`\`) instead of a single quote (`'`). Additionally, you're encountering a **quota exceeded** error because the query scans a large amount of data.

**Here's how you can address these issues:**

---

### **1. Correct the Syntax Error**

**Incorrect Line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31`
```

**Corrected Line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
```

**Corrected Query:**

WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
GROUP BY month
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **2. Address the Quota Exceeded Error**

Even after fixing the syntax, you're likely to still encounter the **quota exceeded** error because querying data for the entire year of 2018 scans a significant amount of data, which exceeds your free tier quota.

**BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned. To resolve this, you can reduce the amount of data scanned by limiting the date range or sampling the data.

---

#### **Option A: Limit the Date Range**

By narrowing the date range, you reduce the data scanned, which can help avoid exceeding your quota.

**Example: Query for a Single Month**

```sql
-- Get the number of trips per day in January 2018.
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS day,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
GROUP BY day
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Example: Query for a Single Day**

```sql
-- Get the number of trips per hour on January 1, 2018.
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS hour,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY hour
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Benefits:**

- **Partition Pruning:** The `taxi_trips` table is partitioned by `trip_start_timestamp`. Filtering on this column allows BigQuery to scan only the relevant partitions.
- **Reduced Data Scanned:** Limiting the date range reduces the amount of data processed, helping you stay within your quota.

---

#### **Option B: Sample the Data**

Sampling allows you to analyze a subset of the data, further reducing the amount scanned.

**Example: Sample Approximately 1% of the Data**

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of the data in 2018.
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1  -- Adjust the modulus for sampling rate
GROUP BY month
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1` selects approximately 1% of the data.
- Adjust the value `100` in the modulus to change the sampling rate (e.g., `1000` for 0.1% sampling).

#### **Option C: Check Your Quota Usage**

It's possible you've reached your project's free query quota for the month.

**To Check Your Quota:**

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console Quotas Page:**

   - [GCP Console Quotas](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas)

2. **Filter for BigQuery API Quotas:**

   - Look for metrics like "BigQuery API: Query usage per day."

3. **Review Your Usage:**

   - Compare your current usage against the allowed quota.

**If You've Exceeded Your Quota:**

- **Wait for Quota Reset:** The free tier quotas reset monthly.
- **Enable Billing:** To process more data immediately, consider enabling billing (see Option D).

---

#### **Option D: Enable Billing to Increase Quota**

If you need to process large amounts of data regularly, enabling billing allows you to exceed the free tier limits.

**Steps to Enable Billing:**

1. **Set Up a Billing Account:**

   - In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/), create a billing account.

2. **Link Your Project:**

   - Associate your Google Cloud project with the billing account.

3. **Monitor Your Usage:**

   - Use budget alerts and cost controls to monitor expenses.

**Considerations:**

- **Costs:** BigQuery charges based on data processed. Monitor usage to avoid unexpected charges.
- **Benefits:** Access higher quotas and more features.

---

#### **Option E: Use BigQuery's Preview Feature**

If you need to inspect the data without running queries:

1. **Navigate to the Table:**

   - In the BigQuery console, find `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`.

2. **Preview the Data:**

   - Click on the **Preview** tab to view a random sample without consuming your query quota.

---

### **Summary**

- **Corrected the Syntax Error:** Replaced the backtick with a single quote in your `WHERE` clause.
- **Addressed Quota Issues:** Provided options to reduce data scanned and avoid exceeding your quota.
- **Recommendations:**

  - **Limit Date Range:** Focus on smaller time periods.
  - **Sample Data:** Analyze a subset of the data.
  - **Check Quotas:** Review your current usage.
  - **Enable Billing:** Consider if you need to process more data.

2025-01-20 13:21:27 - root - INFO - It appears there's a **syntax error** in your SQL query, specifically an **unclosed string literal** in your `WHERE` clause. Additionally, even after fixing the syntax error, you might encounter a **quota exceeded** error because the query scans a large amount of data.

---

### **1. Correct the Syntax Error**

**Incorrect Line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31`
```

- The closing quote for `'2018-12-31'` is a backtick **\`** instead of a single quote **'**.

**Corrected Line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
```

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
-- 6. Count trips per company per month in 2018.
SELECT company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
GROUP BY company, month
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **2. Address the Quota Exceeded Error**

The `taxi_trips` table is **very large**, containing over **200 million rows**. Querying data for the entire year of 2018 requires scanning a significant amount of data, which exceeds the **BigQuery free tier quota**.

**BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned. Even with `LIMIT 1000`, the query must scan all records matching the `WHERE` clause.

---

### **Solutions to Reduce Data Scanned**

#### **Option A: Limit the Date Range**

**Example: Query a Single Month**

```sql
-- Count trips per company for January 2018.
SELECT company,
       1 AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' 
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Example: Query a Single Day**

```sql
-- Count trips per company for January 1, 2018.
SELECT company,
       1 AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' 
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY company
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Benefits:**

- **Partition Pruning:** The table is partitioned by `trip_start_timestamp`. Filtering on this column allows BigQuery to scan only relevant partitions.
- **Reduced Data Scanned:** Limiting the date range reduces the amount of data processed.

#### **Option B: Sample the Data**

**Example: Sample Approximately 1% of Data**

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of the data for 2018.
SELECT company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1  -- 1% sampling
GROUP BY company, month
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** Adjust the modulus (`100`) to change the sampling rate.

---

### **Proceeding with Your Original Task**

Given the constraints, here's how we can proceed conceptually.

#### **Task Recap:**

**Which three companies had the largest increase in trip numbers between two consecutive months in 2018?**

#### **Approach:**

1. **Calculate Monthly Trip Counts per Company**

   - **Filter Data for 2018:**
     ```sql
     WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
     ```
   - **Group by Company and Month:**
     ```sql
     GROUP BY company, month
     ```
   - **Count Trips:**
     ```sql
     COUNT(*) AS trip_count
     ```

2. **Calculate Month-over-Month Increases**

   - Use the `LAG()` window function:
     ```sql
     LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_count
     ```
   - Calculate the increase:
     ```sql
     trip_count - previous_month_count AS increase
     ```

3. **Find the Maximum Increase per Company**

   - **Group by Company:**
     ```sql
     GROUP BY company
     ```
   - **Determine Maximum Increase:**
     ```sql
     MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
     ```

4. **Retrieve the Top 3 Companies**

   - **Order by Largest Increase:**
     ```sql
     ORDER BY largest_increase DESC
     ```
   - **Limit to Top 3:**
     ```sql
     LIMIT 3
     ```

#### **Conceptual SQL Query**

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate monthly trip counts per company.
WITH monthly_trip_counts AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  GROUP BY
    company, month
),

-- Step 2: Calculate month-over-month increases.
monthly_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    month,
    trip_count,
    LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_count,
    trip_count - LAG(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY month) AS increase
  FROM
    monthly_trip_counts
),

-- Step 3: Find the maximum increase per company.
max_increases AS (
  SELECT
    company,
    MAX(increase) AS largest_increase
  FROM
    monthly_increases
  WHERE
    increase IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY
    company
)

-- Step 4: Retrieve the top 3 companies with the largest increases.
SELECT
  company AS Company_name,
  largest_increase AS Largest_increase
FROM
  max_increases
ORDER BY
  largest_increase DESC
LIMIT
  3;
```

**Note:** Executing this query may still exceed your quota due to the volume of data.

---

### **Final Answer Format**

As per your requested format:

```csv
Company_name,Largest_increase
company1:str,increase1:int
company2:str,increase2:int
company3:str,increase3:int
```

---

### **Alternative Solutions**

#### **Option 1: Enable Billing**

- **Action:** Enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your quota.
- **Benefit:** Allows you to process the necessary data.
- **Considerations:** Monitor your spending to avoid unexpected charges.

#### **Option 2: Use Pre-Aggregated Data**

- **Action:** Look for publicly available datasets with aggregated trip data.
- **Benefit:** Reduces the amount of data you need to process.

#### **Option 3: Limit Data Further**

- **Focus on Specific Companies or Months:**

  - Analyze a subset of companies or a shorter time frame.

#### **Option 4: Proceed Conceptually**

- **Explanation Over Execution:**

  - If execution isn't feasible, explain the methodology and reasoning.

---

### **Summary**

- **Syntax Error Fixed:** Corrected the unclosed string literal by replacing the backtick with a single quote.
- **Quota Issue Addressed:** Provided options to reduce data scanned or enable billing.
- **Conceptual Solution Provided:** Offered a step-by-step approach to solve the original task.
- **Final Answer Format Given:** Aligned with your specified format.

2025-01-20 13:22:11 - root - INFO - It appears there's a **syntax error** in your SQL query due to an **unclosed string literal**. Specifically, in your `WHERE` clause, the closing quote for `'2018-12-31'` is a backtick (\`) instead of a single quote (').

**Incorrect line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31`
```

**Corrected line:**

```sql
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
```

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
-- 6. Count trips per company per month in 2018.
SELECT company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
GROUP BY company, month
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

However, even after fixing the syntax error, you may still encounter the **quota exceeded** error:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

This happens because querying data for the entire year of 2018 scans a large amount of data, which can exceed the free tier quota in BigQuery.

### **Solutions to Resolve the Quota Issue**

To reduce the amount of data scanned and stay within your quota, you can limit the date range, sample the data, or both.

#### **Option 1: Limit the Date Range**

**Example: Query a Single Month**

```sql
-- Count trips per company per month in January 2018.
SELECT company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
GROUP BY company, month
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Example: Query a Single Day**

```sql
-- Count trips per company per day on January 1, 2018.
SELECT company,
       EXTRACT(DAY FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS day,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY company, day
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Benefits:**

- **Reduced Data Scanned:** Limiting the date range decreases the amount of data processed.
- **Partition Pruning:** The `taxi_trips` table is partitioned by `trip_start_timestamp`, so filtering on this column allows BigQuery to scan only the relevant partitions.

#### **Option 2: Sample the Data**

You can sample a fraction of the data to further reduce the data scanned.

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of the data for 2018.
SELECT company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1  -- Adjust the modulus for sampling rate
GROUP BY company, month
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1` selects approximately 1% of the data.
- Adjust the modulus value (`100`) to change the sampling rate (e.g., use `1000` for 0.1% sampling).

**Note:** Sampling reduces the accuracy of your results but can provide a reasonable approximation when dealing with large datasets.

#### **Option 3: Combine Both Methods**

You can both limit the date range and sample the data to minimize data scanned.

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of data for January 2018.
SELECT company,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01'
  AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1
GROUP BY company, month
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **Option 4: Check Your Quota Usage**

It's possible that you've already reached your BigQuery free tier quota for the month.

- **To Check Your Quota Usage:**
  - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
  - Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.
  - Review your usage and limits.

If you've exceeded your quota, you may need to wait until the quota resets next month or consider enabling billing.

#### **Option 5: Enable Billing to Increase Quota**

Enabling billing allows you to process more data than the free tier limit.

- **Steps to Enable Billing:**
  - Set up a billing account in the Google Cloud Console.
  - Link your project to the billing account.

- **Considerations:**
  - Monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.
  - Set budget alerts in the Cloud Console to track spending.

---

### **Summary**

- **Fix the Syntax Error:** Replace the backtick with a single quote in your `WHERE` clause.
- **Reduce Data Scanned:**
  - **Limit the Date Range:** Focus on a shorter time period (e.g., a month or a day).
  - **Sample the Data:** Use hashing functions to analyze a subset of the data.
- **Check Quota Usage:** Verify if you've exceeded your free tier quota.
- **Enable Billing (Optional):** Consider enabling billing to process larger datasets.

```

---

### **2. Address the Quota Exceeded Error**

Even after fixing the syntax error, you're likely to still encounter the **quota exceeded** error:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

This occurs because querying the entire year of 2018 scans a significant amount of data, exceeding the free tier quota in BigQuery.

#### **Solutions to Reduce Data Scanned:**

---

#### **A. Limit the Date Range**

By narrowing the date range, you reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Example: Query a Single Month**

```sql
-- Count trips per company in January 2018.
SELECT
  company,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE
  trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
GROUP BY
  company, month
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Example: Query a Single Day**

```sql
-- Count trips per company on January 1, 2018.
SELECT
  company,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS day,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE
  trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-02'
GROUP BY
  company, day
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Benefits:**

- **Partition Pruning:** The `taxi_trips` table is partitioned by `trip_start_timestamp`. Filtering on this column allows BigQuery to scan only the relevant partitions.
- **Reduced Data Scanned:** Limiting the date range decreases the amount of data processed, helping you stay within your quota.

---

#### **B. Sample the Data**

Sampling a fraction of the data reduces the amount of data scanned.

**Example: Sample Approximately 1% of the Data**

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of the data in 2018.
SELECT
  company,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp) = 2018
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1  -- Adjust modulus for sampling rate
GROUP BY
  company, month
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- The `MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1` condition selects approximately 1% of the data.
- Adjust the modulus value (`100`) to change the sampling rate (e.g., use `1000` for 0.1% sampling).

---

#### **C. Combine Both Methods**

You can further reduce data scanned by both limiting the date range and sampling.

```sql
-- Sample approximately 1% of data for January 2018.
SELECT
  company,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_start_timestamp) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
WHERE
  trip_start_timestamp >= '2018-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-02-01'
  AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(unique_key)), 100) = 1
GROUP BY
  company, month
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

#### **D. Check Your Quota Usage**

It's possible that you've reached your free query quota for the month.

- **To Check Quota Usage:**
  - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).
  - Filter for **BigQuery API** quotas.
  - Review your usage against the limits.

If you've exceeded your quota, you may need to wait until it resets next month or consider enabling billing.

---

#### **E. Enable Billing to Increase Quota**

If you need to process larger datasets, consider enabling billing for your project.

**Steps to Enable Billing:**

1. **Set Up a Billing Account:**
   - In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/), create a billing account.
2. **Link Your Project to the Billing Account:**
   - Associate your project with the billing account to increase your quota.
3. **Monitor Your Usage:**
   - Use budget alerts and cost controls to avoid unexpected charges.

**Considerations:**

- **Benefits:**
  - Access to higher quotas.
  - Ability to process large datasets.
- **Costs:**
  - Charges are based on the amount of data processed.
  - Monitor usage to control expenses.

---

### **Summary**

- **Corrected Syntax Error:** Replace the backtick with a single quote in your `WHERE` clause.
- **Reduced Data Scanned:** Limit the date range and/or sample the data to stay within your quota.
- **Checked Quota Usage:** Ensure you haven't exceeded your monthly limit.
- **Enabled Billing (Optional):** If necessary, enable billing to increase your quota.
