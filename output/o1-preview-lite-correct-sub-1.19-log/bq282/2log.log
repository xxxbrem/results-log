2025-01-20 05:53:34 - root - INFO - Apologies for the error in **Corrected SQL 9**. The syntax error occurs because the comment line is not properly closed due to the missing closing parenthesis. Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 9 (No significant errors; optional filters added)
SELECT t.trip_id, t.start_station_name, t.end_station_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS t
WHERE t.start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND t.end_station_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

If the comment is causing an issue, you can remove or modify it. Here's the SQL query without the comment or with a properly formatted comment:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 9
SELECT t.trip_id, t.start_station_name, t.end_station_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS t
WHERE t.start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND t.end_station_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

In SQL, comment lines starting with `--` should not contain unclosed parentheses or unmatched quotation marks, as this can confuse the parser. The original comment line had an opening parenthesis without a closing one:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 9 (No significant errors
```

This causes the parser to expect a closing parenthesis, leading to the "Unexpected end of statement" error. By completing the comment or removing the problematic part, the syntax error is resolved.

**Updated Corrected SQL 9:**

```sql
SELECT t.trip_id, t.start_station_name, t.end_station_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS t
WHERE t.start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND t.end_station_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

Feel free to run this corrected query.

SELECT t.trip_id, t.start_station_name, t.end_station_name

WHERE t.start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND t.end_station_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

In the previous SQL, the comment line might have been included incorrectly or without proper SQL comment syntax. Ensure that:

- Comments start with `--` and are properly formatted.
- There are no unmatched parentheses or quotation marks in the comments.
- The SQL query begins immediately after the comment line.

---

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 10
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
WHERE council_district IS NULL
  AND status = 'active'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

Similarly, for **Corrected SQL 10**, make sure that:

- The comment is properly formatted without syntax errors.
- There are no unmatched symbols in the comment line.
- The SQL query follows the comment line correctly.

---

**General Guidance:**

- **Avoid Unmatched Symbols in Comments:** Unmatched parentheses, brackets, or quotation marks in comments can cause syntax errors because some SQL parsers may misinterpret them.
  
- **Proper Comment Syntax:** Always start comments with `--` for single-line comments in SQL. Ensure that comments do not interfere with the SQL code execution.

- **Check for Hidden Characters:** Sometimes, copied text may include hidden characters or formatting that can cause execution errors. Ensure that the SQL code is plain text.

- **End Statements Properly:** Although BigQuery does not require semicolons to terminate statements, some SQL environments do. If you encounter an error, try adding a semicolon at the end of your SQL statement.

---

By applying these corrections, the SQL queries should run without syntax errors.
