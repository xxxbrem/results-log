2025-01-20 05:53:34 - root - INFO - Apologies for the error in **Corrected SQL 9**. The syntax error occurs because the comment line is not properly closed due to the missing closing parenthesis. Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 9 (No significant errors; optional filters added)
SELECT t.trip_id, t.start_station_name, t.end_station_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS t
WHERE t.start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND t.end_station_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

If the comment is causing an issue, you can remove or modify it. Here's the SQL query without the comment or with a properly formatted comment:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 9
SELECT t.trip_id, t.start_station_name, t.end_station_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS t
WHERE t.start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND t.end_station_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

In SQL, comment lines starting with `--` should not contain unclosed parentheses or unmatched quotation marks, as this can confuse the parser. The original comment line had an opening parenthesis without a closing one:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 9 (No significant errors
```

This causes the parser to expect a closing parenthesis, leading to the "Unexpected end of statement" error. By completing the comment or removing the problematic part, the syntax error is resolved.

**Updated Corrected SQL 9:**

```sql
SELECT t.trip_id, t.start_station_name, t.end_station_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS t
WHERE t.start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND t.end_station_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

Feel free to run this corrected query.

SELECT t.trip_id, t.start_station_name, t.end_station_name

WHERE t.start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND t.end_station_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

In the previous SQL, the comment line might have been included incorrectly or without proper SQL comment syntax. Ensure that:

- Comments start with `--` and are properly formatted.
- There are no unmatched parentheses or quotation marks in the comments.
- The SQL query begins immediately after the comment line.

---

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 10
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
WHERE council_district IS NULL
  AND status = 'active'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

Similarly, for **Corrected SQL 10**, make sure that:

- The comment is properly formatted without syntax errors.
- There are no unmatched symbols in the comment line.
- The SQL query follows the comment line correctly.

---

**General Guidance:**

- **Avoid Unmatched Symbols in Comments:** Unmatched parentheses, brackets, or quotation marks in comments can cause syntax errors because some SQL parsers may misinterpret them.
  
- **Proper Comment Syntax:** Always start comments with `--` for single-line comments in SQL. Ensure that comments do not interfere with the SQL code execution.

- **Check for Hidden Characters:** Sometimes, copied text may include hidden characters or formatting that can cause execution errors. Ensure that the SQL code is plain text.

- **End Statements Properly:** Although BigQuery does not require semicolons to terminate statements, some SQL environments do. If you encounter an error, try adding a semicolon at the end of your SQL statement.

---

By applying these corrections, the SQL queries should run without syntax errors.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`**
  - `start_station_id` (INT64): Used to identify the starting station of each trip.
  - `end_station_id` (STRING): Used to identify the ending station of each trip.
  - `start_station_name` (STRING): Name of the starting station.
  - `end_station_name` (STRING): Name of the ending station.

- **`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`**
  - `station_id` (INT64): Unique identifier for each station; used to join with `start_station_id` and `end_station_id`.
  - `council_district` (INT64): The council district code where the station is located.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- Convert `end_station_id` to INT64 to match data type of `start_station_id` and `station_id`.
- Join `bikeshare_trips` with `bikeshare_stations` on `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` to get the council districts.
- Filter trips where:
  - The start and end stations are in the same council district (`start_council_district = end_council_district`).
  - The start and end stations are different (`start_station_id != end_station_id`).

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT station_id, council_district
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Find trips where `start_station_id` equals `end_station_id`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE start_station_id = SAFE_CAST(end_station_id AS INT64)
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Count total number of trips:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_trips
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`;
   ```

9. **List distinct `council_district` values from stations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT council_district
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   WHERE council_district IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Find trips where start and end stations are in the same district but not the same station (sample data):**
    ```sql
    SELECT t.trip_id, t.start_station_id, t.end_station_id
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS t
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS s_start

Task: Can you tell me the numeric value of the active council district in Austin which has the highest number of bike trips that start and end within the same district, but not at the same station?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The numeric value of the active council district in Austin with the highest number of bike trips that start and end within the same district but not at the same station requires analysis of the actual data from the `bikeshare_trips` and `bikeshare_stations` tables. Without access to this data, the specific district code cannot be determined.

However, the answer format as per your request would be:

```csv
council_district_code
code:int(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**
To find the council district code, you would need to:

1. **Join** the `bikeshare_trips` table with the `bikeshare_stations` table twice—once for the start station and once for the end station—to get the council district codes for both the start and end stations of each trip.
2. **Filter** the trips where the start and end stations are in the same council district but are different stations.
3. **Count** the number of such trips for each council district.
4. **Identify** the council district with the highest count.

Since we cannot perform these steps without the actual data, we cannot provide the specific numeric value..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'austin_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'austin_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_stations', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'austin_crime': ['crime'], 'austin_incidents': ['incidents_2008', 'incidents_2009', 'incidents_2010', 'incidents_2011', 'incidents_2016'], 'austin_waste': ['waste_and_diversion']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 05:56:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you tell me the numeric value of the active council district in Austin which has the highest number of bike trips that start and end within the same district, but not at the same station?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The numeric value of the active council district in Austin with the highest number of bike trips that start and end within the same district but not at the same station requires analysis of the actual data from the `bikeshare_trips` and `bikeshare_stations` tables. Without access to this data, the specific district code cannot be determined.

```csv
council_district_code
code:int(Attention: answer in one row)

2. **Filter** the trips where the start and end stations are in the same council district but are different stations.
3. **Count** the number of such trips for each council district.
4. **Identify** the council district with the highest count.

Since we cannot perform these steps without the actual data, we cannot provide the specific numeric value. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
