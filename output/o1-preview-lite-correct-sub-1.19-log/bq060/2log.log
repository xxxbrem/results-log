**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `country_names_area`
  - `country_code`: Used to join with `birth_death_growth_rates` table.
  - `country_name`: Provides the name of the country.
  - `country_area`: Used to filter countries with an area greater than 500 square kilometers (`country_area > 500`).

- **Table:** `birth_death_growth_rates`
  - `country_code`: Used to join with `country_names_area` table.
  - `country_name`: Provides the name of the country.
  - `year`: Used to select data for the year 2017 (`year = 2017`).
  - `net_migration`: Used to find the net migration rates for each country.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `year = 2017`: To get data specific to the year 2017.
- `country_area > 500`: To filter countries with an area greater than 500 square kilometers.
- `net_migration IS NOT NULL`: To exclude countries with missing net migration data.

    WHERE b.`year` = 2017 AND c.`country_area` > 500
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Rank countries by net migration rate per 1,000 population in 2017:**
    ```sql
    SELECT b.`country_name`, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY b.`net_migration` DESC) AS rank, b.`net_migration`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.birth_death_growth_rates` AS b
    WHERE b.`year` = 2017
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Find countries with missing area data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT `country_name`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.country_names_area`
    WHERE `country_area` IS NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **List countries and their net migration rates where area is greater than 500 and net migration is positive:**
    ```sql
    SELECT b.`country_name`, c.`country_area`, b.`net_migration`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.birth_death_growth_rates` AS b
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.country_names_area` AS c
    ON b.`country_code` = c.`country_code`
    WHERE b.`year` = 2017 AND c.`country_area` > 500 AND b.`net_migration` > 0
    ORDER BY b.`net_migration` DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: In 2017, among countries with an area greater than 500 square kilometers, the top three countries with the highest net migration rates were Oman, Qatar, and Luxembourg. Their net migration rates, measured as the net number of migrants per 1,000 population, are listed below.

```csv
Country_name,Net_migration_rate
Oman,33.1
Qatar,18.2
Luxembourg,15.0
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'census_bureau_international': ['age_specific_fertility_rates', 'birth_death_growth_rates', 'country_names_area', 'midyear_population', 'midyear_population_5yr_age_sex', 'midyear_population_age_sex', 'midyear_population_agespecific', 'mortality_life_expectancy']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
