We are compiling this time series data from national and municipal health departments, vital statistics offices and other official sources in order to better understand the true toll of the pandemic and provide a record for researchers and the public.\n\nOfficial Covid-19 death tolls offer a limited view of the impact of the outbreak because they often exclude people who have not been tested and those who died at home. All-cause mortality is widely used by demographers and other researchers to understand the full impact of deadly events, including epidemics, wars and natural disasters. The totals in this data include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated or did not seek treatment for other conditions.\n\nWe have used this data to produce graphics tracking the oubreak's toll and stories about the United States, Ecuador, Russia, Turkey, Sweden and other countries. We would like to thank a number of demographers and other researchers, listed at the end, who have provided data or helped interpret it.\n\nSourced from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths.""

Task: Analyze daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, identifying the top five states by daily increases. Please compile a ranking based on how often each state appears in these daily top fives. Then, examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: After analyzing the daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, we found that Illinois ranked fourth overall based on how frequently it appeared in the daily top five states with the highest increases. Below are the top five counties in Illinois, ranked by how often they appeared in the daily top five new case counts within the state during that period.

```csv
County,Frequency
Cook County,80
DuPage County,45
Lake County,40
Will County,35
Kane County,30
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_nyt': ['excess_deaths', 'mask_use_by_county', 'us_counties', 'us_states']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 03:30:43 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Analyze daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, identifying the top five states by daily increases. Please compile a ranking based on how often each state appears in these daily top fives. Then, examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: After analyzing the daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, we found that Illinois ranked fourth overall based on how frequently it appeared in the daily top five states with the highest increases. Below are the top five counties in Illinois, ranked by how often they appeared in the daily top five new case counts within the state during that period.

```csv
County,Frequency
Cook County,80
DuPage County,45
Lake County,40
Will County,35
Kane County,30
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
