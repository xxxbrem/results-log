After carefully comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have concluded that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for the task at hand.

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Partitioning in LAG Function:**
   - In `1result.sql`, the `LAG` function for calculating daily new cases at the county level partitions by both `state_name` and `county`:
     ```sql
     LAG(confirmed_cases) OVER (PARTITION BY state_name, county ORDER BY date) AS daily_new_cases
     ```
   - This ensures accurate calculations of daily new cases by considering the specific county within the state, avoiding any potential issues with counties that share the same name across different states.
   - In `2result.sql`, the `LAG` function partitions only by `county`:
     ```sql
     LAG(confirmed_cases) OVER (PARTITION BY county ORDER BY date) AS daily_new_cases
     ```
     This could lead to incorrect calculations if there are counties with the same name in other states.

2. **State Ranking with DENSE_RANK:**
   - `1result.sql` uses `DENSE_RANK` when ranking states based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top fives:
     ```sql
     DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS state_overall_rank
     ```
     This method assigns the same rank to states with equal frequencies, properly reflecting ties.
   - `2result.sql` uses `ROW_NUMBER` for ranking:
     ```sql
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS state_rank
     ```
     This assigns unique ranks even if states have the same frequency, which might not accurately represent the actual standings in case of ties.

3. **Consistency in Results:**
   - The slight differences in frequencies between the two results suggest that `1result.sql` more accurately accounts for the data specifics.
   - For example, Cook County appears 91 times in `1result.csv` from `1result.sql`, whereas it appears 90 times in `2result.csv`. Given the importance of precise counts in this analysis, the method that accounts for all occurrences (as in `1result.sql`) is preferable.

By considering the proper partitioning and ranking methods, `1result.sql` provides a more accurate and reliable analysis for identifying the top states and counties based on daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020.
