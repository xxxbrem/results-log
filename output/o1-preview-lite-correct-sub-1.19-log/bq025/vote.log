After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that all three queries produce the same correct output, listing the top 10 countries with the highest percentage of their population under 20 years old in 2020. Each query accurately calculates the total population under 20, the total midyear population, and the percentage for each country.

However, **Query 2** stands out due to its clarity and adherence to good SQL practices:

- **Use of Clear CTEs**: Query 2 uses Common Table Expressions (`WITH` clauses) with descriptive names (`population_under_20` and `total_population`), making the query easier to read and understand.
- **Conciseness**: The query is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity found in subqueries or additional aliases.
- **Standard Joins**: It employs a `JOIN` using the `USING` clause, which simplifies the join condition when column names are the same.

Therefore, **Query 2** is the preferred choice for providing the correct and most readable SQL solution.
