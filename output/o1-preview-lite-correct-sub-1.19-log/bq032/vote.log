```plain
2result.sql
```

We choose **2result.sql** as the correct SQL for the following reasons:

1. **Filtering on `track_type`:** The second SQL query includes a filter on `track_type = 'main'`, ensuring that only the main track points of the hurricanes are considered. This is important because hurricanes may have spur tracks or other non-primary paths that could artificially inflate the total distance traveled if included. By focusing on the main track, the query more accurately reflects the actual distance the hurricane traveled.

2. **Correct Calculation of the Final Latitude:**
   - In **2result.sql**, the final latitude is obtained by ordering the data points of the second longest-traveled hurricane by `iso_time` in descending order and selecting the first one (`LIMIT 1`). This correctly captures the last recorded latitude of the hurricane.
   - In **1result.sql**, there is a possible error in the final selection step. The `WHERE` clause uses `last_position.rn = 11`, which would select the 11th latest data point instead of the most recent one. This could lead to an incorrect latitude being reported. The correct approach should be `WHERE last_position.rn = 1` to get the latest position.

3. **Consistency and Clarity:** The second SQL is more precise in its logic and ensures that the data used for calculations accurately represents the main path of the hurricanes. This makes the second query more reliable for determining the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance and retrieving its final latitude.

By carefully considering these factors, **2result.sql** is the better and correct choice for answering the task.
