Begin Exploring Related Columns
Relevant Tables and Columns:

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
  - `bike_type`: to identify electric bikes.
  - `duration_minutes`: to filter rides lasting more than 10 minutes.
  - `subscriber_type`: to select 'Student Membership'.
  - `start_time`: to group rides by day.
  - `start_station_name`: to exclude rides starting at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'.
  - `end_station_name`: to exclude rides ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'.

Conditions that may be used:

- `bike_type = 'Electric'`
- `duration_minutes > 10`
- `subscriber_type = 'Student Membership'`
- `start_station_name NOT IN ('Mobile Station', 'Repair Shop')`
- `end_station_name NOT IN ('Mobile Station', 'Repair Shop')`

Here are 10 simple SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **Retrieve distinct bike types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `bike_type`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct subscriber types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `subscriber_type`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **List rides with duration over 10 minutes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `trip_id`, `duration_minutes`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE `duration_minutes` > 10
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **List rides taken by 'Student Membership' subscribers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `trip_id`, `subscriber_type`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE `subscriber_type` = 'Student Membership'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **List rides on electric bikes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `trip_id`, `bike_type`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE `bike_type` = 'Electric'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Retrieve start station names excluding 'Mobile Station' and 'Repair Shop':**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `start_station_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE `start_station_name` NOT IN ('Mobile Station', 'Repair Shop')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Retrieve end station names excluding 'Mobile Station' and 'Repair Shop':**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `end_station_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE `end_station_name` NOT IN ('Mobile Station', 'Repair Shop')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **List rides with start times for grouping by day:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `trip_id`, `start_time`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **List rides longer than 10 minutes on electric bikes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `trip_id`, `duration_minutes`, `bike_type`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE `duration_minutes` > 10 AND `bike_type` = 'Electric'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **List rides satisfying all conditions:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `trip_id`, `subscriber_type`, `bike_type`, `duration_minutes`, `start_station_name`, `end_station_name`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
    WHERE `bike_type` = 'Electric'
      AND `duration_minutes` > 10
      AND `subscriber_type` = 'Student Membership'
      AND `start_station_name` NOT IN ('Mobile Station', 'Repair Shop')
      AND `end_station_name` NOT IN ('Mobile Station', 'Repair Shop')
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
highest_num_trips
num_trips:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'austin_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'austin_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_stations', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'austin_crime': ['crime'], 'austin_incidents': ['incidents_2008', 'incidents_2009', 'incidents_2010', 'incidents_2011', 'incidents_2016'], 'austin_waste': ['waste_and_diversion']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 05:42:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
highest_num_trips
num_trips:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
