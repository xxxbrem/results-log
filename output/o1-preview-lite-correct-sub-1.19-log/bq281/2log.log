2025-01-20 05:43:31 - root - INFO - The error message indicates a type mismatch error due to comparing an `INT64` (integer) column with a `STRING`. Specifically, the condition `start_station_id <> ''` is causing the issue because `start_station_id` is an integer, and `''` is a string. Comparing different data types with the `!=` or `<>` operator leads to this error.

To fix the error, we need to remove comparisons between integer columns and empty strings. Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE LOWER(start_station_name) LIKE '%mobile%'
   OR LOWER(start_station_name) LIKE '%repair%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

If you originally included conditions to ensure that `start_station_name` is not null or empty, you can adjust the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND start_station_name <> ''
  AND (LOWER(start_station_name) LIKE '%mobile%'
       OR LOWER(start_station_name) LIKE '%repair%')
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Removed invalid comparisons:** I removed conditions like `start_station_id <> ''` and `end_station_id <> ''` because comparing an integer column (`INT64`) to an empty string (`''`) causes a type mismatch error.
- **Ensured string comparisons are valid:** Retained `start_station_name IS NOT NULL` and `start_station_name <> ''` to exclude null or empty station names.
- **Grouped `OR` conditions properly:** Enclosed the `OR` conditions in parentheses to ensure the SQL logic is correct.

**Note on Other SQL Queries:**

For the other queries that might have similar errors, here's how you can correct them by removing invalid comparisons between integer columns and strings.

    ```
    **No change needed** for this query.

**Summary:**

- **Avoid comparing integer columns to strings:** Remove any conditions where an integer column is compared to an empty string `''`.
- **Ensure string columns are valid:** For string columns, you can check for null or empty strings using `IS NOT NULL` and `<> ''`.
- **Type consistency:** Always ensure that the data types on both sides of a comparison operator are compatible.

By applying these corrections, the SQL queries should run without type mismatch errors.

2025-01-20 05:46:02 - root - INFO - The error message indicates that there's a type mismatch due to comparing an `INT64` (integer) column with a `STRING` using the `<>` operator. Specifically, comparing an integer column like `end_station_id` to an empty string `''` will cause this error.

In your query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE end_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND end_station_name <> ''
  AND (LOWER(end_station_name) LIKE '%mobile%'
       OR LOWER(end_station_name) LIKE '%repair%')
LIMIT 1000
```

It seems correct because `end_station_name` is a `STRING` column. However, the error mentions a comparison between `INT64` and `STRING`, which suggests that somewhere in the query (or perhaps in another query), there might be an invalid comparison like `end_station_id <> ''`.

To fix the error, ensure that you're not comparing integer columns to strings. Remove any conditions where an `INT64` column is compared to a `STRING`, such as `end_station_id <> ''` or `end_station_id = ''`.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE end_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND end_station_name <> ''
  AND (LOWER(end_station_name) LIKE '%mobile%'
       OR LOWER(end_station_name) LIKE '%repair%')
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Removed Invalid Comparisons:** Ensure that you are **not** comparing integer columns like `end_station_id` to strings like `''`. Such comparisons are invalid and cause type mismatch errors.
  
- **Verify Column Data Types:** 

  - `end_station_id`: This is an `INT64` column (integer).
  - `end_station_name`: This is a `STRING` column.

- **Valid Comparisons:**

  - For `STRING` columns (e.g., `end_station_name`), you can compare using `<> ''` to check for non-empty strings.
  - For `INT64` columns, you should compare with numerical values (e.g., `end_station_id <> 0` if appropriate).

**Additional Notes:**

- **Ensure Other Queries Don't Have Similar Errors:** Review your other SQL queries to make sure there are no comparisons between `INT64` columns and `STRING` literals.

- **Example of Incorrect Comparison:**

  ```sql
  -- Incorrect: Comparing INT64 to STRING
  WHERE end_station_id <> ''
  ```

  This should be removed or corrected.

- **Example of Correct Comparison:**

  ```sql
  -- Correct: Checking if INT64 column is not NULL
  WHERE end_station_id IS NOT NULL
  ```

**Summary of Steps to Fix the Error:**

1. **Remove Invalid Comparisons:**

   - Eliminate any conditions where integer columns are compared to strings.

2. **Adjust Conditions Appropriately:**

   - For `INT64` columns, use conditions like `IS NOT NULL` or compare with numeric values.
   - For `STRING` columns, you can use conditions like `<> ''` or `LIKE`.

3. **Validate Data Types:**

   - Always ensure that both sides of a comparison operator are of compatible data types.

4. **Check the Entire Query:**

   - Even if the problematic comparison isn't immediately visible, it might exist elsewhere in the query.

**Corrected Queries for Similar Errors:**

Here are the corrected versions of other queries that might have similar issues:

---

```sql
-- Corrected 4:

-- Ensure no invalid comparisons with INT64 columns
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE end_station_name IS NOT NULL
  -- Removed end_station_name <> '' because end_station_name IS NOT NULL suffices
  AND (LOWER(end_station_name) LIKE '%mobile%'
       OR LOWER(end_station_name) LIKE '%repair%')
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

```sql
-- Corrected 8:

-- Ensure no invalid comparisons with INT64 columns
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE subscriber_type IS NOT NULL
  AND subscriber_type <> ''
  AND start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND start_station_name <> ''
  AND end_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND end_station_name <> ''
  AND LOWER(subscriber_type) LIKE '%student%'
  AND LOWER(bike_type) LIKE '%electric%'
  AND duration_minutes > 10
  AND LOWER(start_station_name) NOT LIKE '%mobile%'
  AND LOWER(start_station_name) NOT LIKE '%repair%'
  AND LOWER(end_station_name) NOT LIKE '%mobile%'
  AND LOWER(end_station_name) NOT LIKE '%repair%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**General Recommendations:**

- **Use `IS NOT NULL` for NULL Checks:**

  - When checking if a column is not `NULL`, use `IS NOT NULL`.
  - Comparing a column to an empty string (`''`) is appropriate only for `STRING` columns.

- **Avoid Comparing Different Data Types:**

  - Comparisons should be between the same or compatible data types.

- **Validate Conditions:**

  - Ensure that each condition in your `WHERE` clause is valid and logical.
  - Review all conditions to prevent inadvertent errors.

**Conclusion:**

By ensuring all comparisons are between compatible data types and removing any invalid conditions, your queries should run without errors. If you continue to encounter issues, double-check all parts of your query for any inadvertent type mismatches.

Task: What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
highest_num_trips
num_trips:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'austin_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'austin_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_stations', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'austin_crime': ['crime'], 'austin_incidents': ['incidents_2008', 'incidents_2009', 'incidents_2010', 'incidents_2011', 'incidents_2016'], 'austin_waste': ['waste_and_diversion']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 05:48:21 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
highest_num_trips
num_trips:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
