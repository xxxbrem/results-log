The correct SQL is **`2result.sql`**.

**Reason:**

`2result.sql` is the most appropriate query because it thoroughly satisfies all the conditions of the task:

1. **Handles NULL and Empty Station Names:**
   - It includes checks to ensure that `start_station_name` and `end_station_name` are neither `NULL` nor empty strings.
   - This prevents any `NULL` or empty values from causing unexpected results or errors in the query.

2. **Case-Insensitive Comparison:**
   - It uses the `LOWER()` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'.
   - This ensures that station names with different cases (e.g., 'mobile station', 'Mobile Station', 'MOBILE STATION') are all correctly identified and excluded.

3. **Comprehensive Exclusion Conditions:**
   - By combining these checks, the query accurately excludes all rides that start or end at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop', regardless of variations in capitalization or presence of NULL/empty values.

4. **Meets All Task Requirements:**
   - Filters for rides taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership'.
   - Filters for rides on electric bikes.
   - Filters for rides lasting more than 10 minutes.
   - Excludes rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'.
   - Groups the rides by date and selects the highest count.

**Therefore, `2result.sql` is the most robust and accurate query for determining the highest number of qualifying rides in a single day.**
