2025-01-20 10:31:26 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering indicates that your query is scanning more data than allowed under the free quota for BigQuery. This happens because the `SELECT *` statement instructs BigQuery to scan all columns for the specified rows, which can be costly in large tables.

**To resolve this issue and avoid exceeding the quota, you should:**

1. **Select Only Necessary Columns:** Instead of using `SELECT *`, specify only the columns you need for your analysis.

2. **Use Filters Effectively:** Apply filters that limit the amount of data scanned. This includes filtering by `country_name`, `value`, and any other relevant conditions.

3. **Aggregate Data Appropriately:** Use aggregate functions to calculate the required results without retrieving all individual rows.

**Rewriting Your Query to Be More Efficient:**

To answer your original task:

*How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?*

Here's an efficient query that minimizes the data scanned:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_name`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
```

**Explanation:**

- **COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_name`)**: Counts the number of unique debt indicators.
- **`country_name` = 'Russian Federation'**: Filters records for Russia.
- **`value` = 0**: Selects indicators that have a value of 0.
- **`value` IS NOT NULL**: Ensures we exclude NULL values.
- **LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'**: Filters for indicators related to debt.

**By specifying only the necessary columns and applying filters, this query scans significantly less data and should run within the free quota limits.**

**Additional Queries to Explore Data Efficiently:**

If you need to explore the data further, here are optimized queries:

```sql
-- 1. List distinct debt indicators for Russia with value 0
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. Count the total number of debt records for Russia with value 0
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Debt_Records
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%';

-- 3. Retrieve years for which debt indicators have value 0 for Russia
SELECT DISTINCT `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
ORDER BY `year`
LIMIT 1000;

-- 4. Get the total count of debt indicators per year with value 0
SELECT `year`, COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_name`) AS Debt_Indicators_Count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
GROUP BY `year`
ORDER BY `year`
LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. Find all debt indicator codes for Russia with value 0
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**General Tips to Avoid Quota Exceeded Errors:**

- **Select Specific Columns:** Always list the columns you need instead of using `SELECT *`.
- **Use LIMIT Wisely:** While `LIMIT` reduces the number of rows returned, it doesn't limit the amount of data scanned. Filters are more effective.
- **Apply Filters Early:** Conditions in the `WHERE` clause help BigQuery scan only the relevant data.
- **Check Data Size Before Running Queries:** You can use the BigQuery UI to estimate the amount of data your query will scan.

**Final Answer in Required Format:**

Based on the optimized query, here's the result format per your instructions:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Note:** Since we cannot run the query due to quota limitations, we cannot provide the exact number. However, the above query will give you the count of unique debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0 when executed.

**Summary:**

By refining your query to be more efficient and selecting only necessary data, you can avoid the 'Quota exceeded' error and successfully perform your analysis within BigQuery's free tier limits.
2025-01-20 10:31:49 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:31:49 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering a quota exceeded error when running the query:

```sql
-- 1. Retrieve all records for Russia
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error:**
```
400 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

The error indicates that your query is scanning more data than allowed under your project's quota. In BigQuery, even if you use `LIMIT`, the query still scans all the data required to process the query before applying the limit. Therefore, specifying `LIMIT 1000` does not reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Why the Query Exceeds Quota:**

- **Using `SELECT *`:** Selecting all columns (`*`) retrieves every column in the table, which can be very large in wide tables.
- **Large Table Size:** The `international_debt` table contains a significant amount of data. Filtering only by `country_name` may still include many rows and columns.
- **Quota Limits:** Free tier quotas in BigQuery limit the amount of data you can scan per day. Exceeding this limit results in the error you're seeing.

**Solution:**

To avoid exceeding your quota, you need to optimize your query to scan less data. Here are steps to achieve this:

1. **Select Only Necessary Columns:**

   Instead of `SELECT *`, specify only the columns you need. This reduces the amount of data scanned.

2. **Use Efficient Filters:**

   Ensure your `WHERE` clause filters out as much unnecessary data as possible.

3. **Estimate the Data to Be Scanned:**

   Use BigQuery's query validator to estimate how much data your query will scan before running it.

**Optimized Query:**

Given your task is to **find the number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0, excluding NULL values**, here's an optimized query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_name`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
```

**Why This Query Is More Efficient:**

- **Selecting Specific Columns:** We're only selecting `indicator_name`, and we're using `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)`, which reduces the data scanned.
- **Filtering by Value:** Applying `value = 0` and `value IS NOT NULL` filters out unnecessary rows.
- **Filtering by Indicator Name:** Using `LOWER(indicator_name) LIKE '%debt%'` ensures we only consider debt-related indicators.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid `SELECT *`:** Always specify the exact columns you need.
- **Check Data Size Before Running Queries:**

  In the BigQuery UI:

  - Paste your query into the query editor.
  - Click on the **'Execution details'** or **'Query Plan'** tab.
  - BigQuery estimates the number of bytes that will be scanned.
  - Ensure this number is within your quota before running the query.

- **Use Aggregations Wisely:**

  Aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG` can help reduce the amount of data processed when used appropriately.

**Final Answer in Required Format:**

Based on the query above, and since we cannot execute it due to quota limitations, we can present the expected output format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Conclusion:**

To resolve the quota error:

- Optimize your query to scan less data.
- Select only the necessary columns.
- Use filters effectively to limit the data processed.
- Estimate the amount of data your query will scan before executing it.

**Additional Assistance:**

If you're still encountering issues, you might consider:

- **Testing with a Smaller Dataset:**

  - If possible, limit your query to a smaller subset, such as a specific year.

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_name`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
    WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
      AND `value` = 0
      AND `value` IS NOT NULL
      AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
      AND `year` = 2020  -- or any specific year
    ```

- **Upgrading Your Quota:**

  - If you need to run queries that exceed the free tier limits, consider upgrading your BigQuery project to a paid tier where you can increase your quota.

- **Using Preview Options:**

  - In the BigQuery UI, you can preview table data without running a full query, which doesn't count against your quota.

**Remember:** Efficient querying is crucial when working with large datasets to manage resources effectively and avoid exceeding quotas.

2025-01-20 10:32:30 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
LIMIT 1000
```

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because, even with the `LIMIT 1000` clause, BigQuery scans all the data that matches the `WHERE` clause before applying the limit. Additionally, using `SELECT *` retrieves all columns in the table, which increases the amount of data scanned. If the total bytes scanned exceed your project's free quota, you'll receive a quota exceeded error.

**Solution:**

To avoid exceeding your quota, you can optimize your query by:

1. **Selecting Only Required Columns:**

   Specify only the columns necessary for your analysis.

2. **Using Efficient Filters:**

   Apply filters that reduce the number of rows processed.

3. **Aggregating Data:**

   Use aggregate functions to compute the result without retrieving all individual rows.

**Optimized Query for Your Task:**

To find **how many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values**, you can use the following optimized query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
```

**Explanation:**

- **`COUNT(DISTINCT indicator_code)`:** Counts the unique debt indicators.
- **Filters Applied:**
  - `country_name = 'Russian Federation'`: Selects data for Russia.
  - `value = 0`: Includes only records where the value is 0.
  - `value IS NOT NULL`: Excludes NULL values.
  - `LOWER(indicator_name) LIKE '%debt%'`: Filters for indicators related to debt.

**Steps to Run the Query Without Exceeding Quota:**

1. **Use the BigQuery UI to Estimate Data Scanned:**

   - Paste the optimized query into the query editor.
   - BigQuery displays an estimate of the bytes to be processed below the query editor.
   - Ensure that the estimated data scanned is within your quota limits.

2. **Adjust the Query if Necessary:**

   - If the estimated data is still too high, consider further limiting the data by adding more specific filters, such as restricting the years:
     ```sql
     AND `year` >= 2015
     ```
   - You can also comment out unnecessary filters to see their impact on the estimated data scanned.

3. **Run the Query:**

   - If the estimated data scanned is acceptable, run the query to get your result.

**Final Answer in the Required Format:**

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Note:** Since I cannot execute the query for you, please run the optimized query above in your BigQuery console to obtain the exact number.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid `SELECT *`:** Always specify only the columns you need.
- **Check Data Size Before Running Queries:** Use the BigQuery UI to estimate the amount of data your query will scan.
- **Aggregate Data:** Use functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, or `AVG` to compute results without fetching all rows.

**Example of Checking Estimated Bytes:**

- After pasting your query into the editor, look for a message like "This query will process XX MB when run."
- If the size is within your quota (e.g., under 1 GB for the free tier), you can proceed.
- If not, refine your query further.

**Conclusion:**

By optimizing your query to select only necessary columns and applying appropriate filters, you should be able to retrieve the required information without exceeding your quota.

2025-01-20 10:33:18 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:33:18 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still receiving "Quota exceeded" errors when attempting to run even the optimized queries. This happens because, despite filtering, the amount of data being scanned still exceeds your project's quota in BigQuery. Here's how we can address this issue and provide the best possible answer.

---

### **Explanation:**

- **BigQuery Data Scanning Charges:**
  - BigQuery charges based on the amount of data scanned during query execution.
  - Applying filters in the `WHERE` clause helps reduce the number of rows returned but doesn't always significantly reduce the data scanned.
  - The `LIMIT` clause limits the number of rows **returned** but does not limit the amount of data **scanned**.

- **Why the Error Persists:**
  - The `international_debt` table is quite large, and even with filters, scanning the necessary data for Russia exceeds your free tier quota.
  - Quotas for the free tier are limited; exceeding them results in the "Quota exceeded" error.

---

### **Potential Solutions:**

1. **Further Reduce Data Scanned:**

   - **Filter by Year or Specific Indicators:**
     - Add more restrictive conditions to your query to reduce data scanned.
     - For example, filter for specific years or known indicator codes.

   - **Example Query Filtering by Year:**
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
     WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
       AND `value` = 0
       AND `value` IS NOT NULL
       AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
       AND `year` >= 2020  -- Adjust the year as needed
     ```

2. **Use Metadata Tables:**

   - **Query Smaller Tables:**
     - The `series_summary` table contains information about indicators and is much smaller.
     - You can find all debt-related indicators from this table without exceeding your quota.

   - **Example Query on `series_summary`:**
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `series_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.series_summary`
     WHERE LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
     ```

     - Note: This provides the total number of debt indicators available, not specific to Russia or their values.

3. **Estimate Based on Available Information:**

   - **Manual Inspection:**
     - Without running queries, we can infer that there are numerous debt indicators in the dataset.
     - It's reasonable to assume that some of these indicators for Russia have a value of 0.

---

### **Final Answer:**

Due to the data processing quota limits, we cannot execute the query to determine the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0. However, we can provide an answer template based on the required format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

---

### **Additional Recommendations:**

- **Upgrade Your Quota:**
  - If possible, consider upgrading your BigQuery project to allow for more data processing.
  - This involves enabling billing and may incur costs based on data scanned.

- **Use a Smaller Dataset:**
  - If you have access to a smaller dataset or can export a subset of the data, you could run your analysis locally.

- **Contact Support:**
  - Reach out to Google Cloud Support for assistance with quota limits if increasing your quota is an option.

---

### **Summary:**

- The "Quota exceeded" error occurs because the queries, even when optimized, scan more data than your project's quota allows.
- We attempted to minimize data scanned by refining queries, but the dataset size remains a limiting factor.
- Without the ability to execute the query, we cannot provide the exact number requested.

2025-01-20 10:33:59 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when executing your query:

```sql
-- 2. List distinct indicator names for Russia
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error:**
```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

This error occurs because even with the `LIMIT` clause and filters, the query scans more data than your project's quota allows. The `international_debt` table is substantial, and querying it can quickly exceed the free tier limits of BigQuery. The `LIMIT` clause affects the number of rows **returned** but does not limit the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.

---

### **Alternative Solution:**

To answer your original question:

**"How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?"**

we can use an alternative approach that avoids scanning large amounts of data.

#### **Use the `series_summary` Table to Identify Debt Indicators**

The `series_summary` table contains metadata about indicators and is significantly smaller than the `international_debt` table. We can retrieve all debt-related indicators from this table.

**Step 1: Retrieve Debt-Related Indicators**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `series_code`) AS Total_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.series_summary`
WHERE LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
```

This query counts all unique debt indicators available in the dataset.

**Note:** This count represents all debt indicators in the dataset, not specifically for Russia.

#### **Estimate Number of Debt Indicators with Value 0 for Russia**

Without accessing the `international_debt` table to check actual values, we cannot determine exactly how many of these indicators have a value of 0 for Russia. However, since we know the total number of debt indicators, we can acknowledge that the number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0 would be at most equal to this total.

---

### **Final Answer in Required Format:**

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

**Explanation:**

Due to data processing quota limits, we cannot execute queries on the `international_debt` table to determine the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0. The table is too large, and queries exceed the free tier quota even with optimizations.

---

### **Recommendations:**

- **Upgrade Your Quota:**

  - **Enable Billing:** If accessing this data is crucial, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to run larger queries that exceed the free tier limits. Be mindful of potential costs associated with data processing.

- **Work with a Smaller Dataset:**

  - **Extract a Subset:** If possible, obtain a local copy or a smaller subset of the data focusing on Russia. This can be done by exporting the data you need from BigQuery or accessing it through other means provided by the data source.

- **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

  - **World Bank API:** Explore the World Bank's API or data portal, which may allow you to retrieve the specific data you need without processing large datasets.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Issue:** Quota limitations prevent querying the large `international_debt` table to get the exact number.
- **Solution:** Use the smaller `series_summary` table to understand the total number of debt indicators.
- **Limitation:** Without accessing the specific values in the `international_debt` table, we cannot determine exactly how many indicators have a value of 0 for Russia.
- **Answer:** Provided the answer in the required `csv` format, acknowledging the inability to determine the exact number due to quota limitations.

2025-01-20 10:34:25 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:34:25 - root - INFO - ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int
```

Due to data processing quota limitations, we are unable to determine the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0, excluding NULL values.

**Explanation:**

To find the number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0, you would typically execute a query on the `international_debt` table as follows:

- **Filter Criteria:**
  - `country_name = 'Russian Federation'`: Select records for Russia.
  - `value = 0`: Include only indicators where the value is zero.
  - `value IS NOT NULL`: Exclude any NULL values.
  - `LOWER(indicator_name) LIKE '%debt%'`: Focus on indicators related to debt.

- **Count Distinct Indicators:**
  - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT indicator_code)` or `COUNT(DISTINCT indicator_name)` to find the unique number of debt indicators meeting the criteria.

However, executing this query requires scanning a significant amount of data, which exceeds the available quota. As a result, we cannot provide the exact number at this time.

**Note:** If you have sufficient quota or access to the dataset, you can run the optimized query to obtain the exact count.

2025-01-20 10:35:49 - root - INFO - I see that you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running the corrected SQL query:

```sql
-- 3. Find records where value is 0 for Russia, excluding NULL values
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `value` = 0 AND `value` IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000
```

### **Explanation:**

The **"Quota exceeded"** error occurs because the query is scanning more data than your BigQuery free tier quota allows. Even though you've corrected the SQL syntax and included a `LIMIT` clause, BigQuery processes the entire dataset that matches the `WHERE` conditions before applying the limit on the number of rows returned. This means the amount of data scanned can still exceed your quota.

### **Why This Happens:**

- **`LIMIT` Clause Limitations:**
  - The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows **returned** by the query but does **not** limit the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.
  
- **Large Dataset Size:**
  - The `international_debt` table is large, and even filtering by `country_name` and `value` may involve scanning a significant portion of the table.

### **Possible Solutions:**

To reduce the amount of data scanned and avoid exceeding your quota, you can try the following:

1. **Add More Specific Filters:**

   - **Filter by Year:**
     - Reduce the data scanned by limiting the query to a specific year or a smaller range of years.
     - **Example:**
       ```sql
       AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace 2020 with a specific year
       ```
     - This will significantly reduce the number of rows processed.

   - **Filter by Specific Indicators:**
     - If you know specific debt-related `indicator_code`s, you can filter using those.
     - **Example:**
       ```sql
       AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.DOD.DIMF.CD')  -- Use relevant codes
       ```
   
   - **Combine Filters:**
     - Applying both year and indicator filters narrows down the dataset further.
     - **Optimized Query:**
       ```sql
       SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
       WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
         AND `value` = 0
         AND `value` IS NOT NULL
         AND `year` = 2020
         AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
       LIMIT 1000;
       ```
   
2. **Select Only Necessary Columns:**

   - You've already minimized the columns selected, which helps reduce data scanned.

3. **Check Data Size Before Running the Query:**

   - In the BigQuery UI, after entering your query, check the estimated amount of data to be processed.
   - Adjust your query until the estimated data scanned is within your quota limit.

4. **Use `EXPLAIN` to Analyze the Query Plan:**

   - You can use the `EXPLAIN` statement to see how BigQuery executes your query and identify ways to optimize it.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     EXPLAIN
     SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
     WHERE ...
     ```

5. **Enable Billing to Increase Quota:**

   - If possible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your data processing quota.
   - Be mindful that this may incur costs based on the amount of data processed.

### **Final Answer:**

Given the data processing limitations, we cannot execute the query without exceeding your quota. Therefore, we're unable to determine the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0, excluding NULL values.

As per your request, here's the expected output format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int
```

**Note:** The `number:int` represents the integer count of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0, excluding NULL values. Unfortunately, we cannot provide the exact number due to the constraints mentioned.

### **Summary:**

- The "Quota exceeded" error occurs because the query scans more data than allowed under your current quota.
- Applying additional filters, such as narrowing down the year or specific indicators, may reduce the data scanned.
- Check the estimated data processed before running the query to ensure it stays within your quota.
- If necessary, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your quota, keeping in mind potential costs.

### **Alternative Approach:**

If reducing the data scanned is not sufficient to run the query within your quota, you might consider:

- **Using the World Bank API or Data Downloader:**

  - The World Bank offers an API and a data download tool that you can use to retrieve specific datasets without the limitations of BigQuery.
  - Visit the [World Bank Data website](https://data.worldbank.org/) for more information.

- **Accessing a Smaller Dataset:**

  - If possible, obtain a smaller subset of the data that includes only the necessary information for your analysis.

2025-01-20 10:36:10 - root - INFO - ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int
```

Due to data processing quota limitations, we are unable to execute the query to determine the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0, excluding NULL values.

**Explanation:**

Despite correcting the SQL syntax and optimizing the query, the "Quota exceeded" error persists because the query scans more data than allowed under your current BigQuery quota. This is because:

- **Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is large, and querying even a filtered subset can exceed free tier quotas.
- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned but does not limit the amount of data scanned during query execution.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Further Optimize the Query:**

   - **Filter by Specific Years:**
     ```sql
     AND `year` = 2020  -- Specify a year
     ```
   - **Filter by Known Indicators:**
     ```sql
     AND `indicator_code` IN ('Indicator_Code1', 'Indicator_Code2')  -- Use specific codes if known
     ```
   - **Combine Filters:** Narrow down the data as much as possible.

   However, even with these optimizations, the data scanned might still exceed your quota.

2. **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

   - **World Bank Open Data Portal:**
     - Access the World Bank’s [Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/) to download datasets directly.
     - Use their [APIs](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) to fetch specific data without quota limitations.

   - **Download Specific Datasets:**
     - Download the international debt data for Russia, which may be available in CSV or Excel formats.
     - Perform the analysis locally without processing limitations.

3. **Upgrade Your BigQuery Quota:**

   - **Enable Billing:**
     - If permissible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your data processing quota.
     - Be cautious of potential costs associated with running large queries.

**Final Recommendation:**

Given the constraints, it's advisable to use the World Bank's data resources directly to obtain the required information. This approach bypasses BigQuery's limitations and allows you to analyze the data as needed.

**Summary:**

- The "Quota exceeded" error occurs due to the large amount of data scanned by the query.
- Optimizations may not sufficiently reduce data scanned to fall within your quota.
- Alternative methods, such as using the World Bank's data portal or APIs, are recommended to obtain the data.

2025-01-20 10:36:40 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:36:40 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a syntax error when executing your SQL query:

```sql
-- 3. Find records where value is 0 for Russia, excluding NULL values
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `value` = 0 AND `value` IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unexpected keyword AND at [1:1]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unexpected keyword AND at [1:1]
```

**Explanation:**

The error message indicates a syntax error at line 1, character 1: `Unexpected keyword AND at [1:1]`. This suggests that the SQL parser encountered an `AND` keyword where it didn't expect one, right at the beginning of the query.

The issue is likely related to the comment at the top of your query. In SQL, comments starting with `--` should not have any preceding characters on the same line, and there should be a space after `--`. Additionally, some SQL environments may not handle comments well when copying and pasting queries.

**Solution:**

1. **Ensure Proper Comment Formatting:**

   - Make sure there's a space after the `--` in your comment.
   - Alternatively, use a multi-line comment syntax `/* ... */`.

2. **Remove the Comment (Recommended for Testing):**

   - To rule out any issues caused by the comment, remove it from your query temporarily.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `value` = 0 AND `value` IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Additional Notes:**

- **Semicolon Usage:** While BigQuery doesn't always require a semicolon at the end of a query, adding one can prevent syntax errors, especially when running multiple queries in the same script.
  
- **Check Quotation Marks:** Ensure that all strings are properly enclosed in single quotes `'...'`. In your `WHERE` clause, `'Russian Federation'` is correctly quoted.

**Possible Next Steps:**

After correcting the syntax error, you might still encounter the "Quota exceeded" error due to the size of the data being scanned. Here's what you can do:

1. **Estimate Data Scanned:**

   - Use the BigQuery console to estimate how much data your query will scan before running it.
   - In the query editor, BigQuery shows an estimate like "This query will process XX MB when run."

2. **Reduce Data Scanned:**

   - **Filter by Year:**
     
     ```sql
     AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace with a specific year to reduce data
     ```
   
   - **Select Specific Indicators:**

     If you can limit the indicators:

     ```sql
     AND `indicator_code` = 'Specific_Code'  -- Replace with known indicator codes
     ```

   - **Limit Columns Selected:**
     
     You've already limited columns to `indicator_name`, `value`, and `year`, which helps reduce the data size.

3. **Enable Billing (If Necessary):**

   - To run queries that exceed the free tier quota, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project.
   - Be aware of potential costs associated with processing large datasets.

**Example with Additional Filters:**

```sql
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Specify a year to reduce data scanned
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Summary:**

- **Syntax Error Resolution:** Remove or properly format the comment at the beginning of your query to fix the syntax error.
- **Quota Consideration:** Be aware that even after fixing the syntax error, you may face quota limitations.
- **Data Optimization:** Apply additional filters to reduce the amount of data scanned.
- **Alternative Data Access:** If issues persist, consider using the World Bank's data portal or APIs to access the data you need.

2025-01-20 10:37:24 - root - INFO - I see that you're encountering a **quota exceeded error** when running your SQL query:

```sql
-- 4. Retrieve all years available for Russia
SELECT DISTINCT `year`

WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation`
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Identifying the Issue:**

1. **Syntax Error:**

   - **Missing Closing Quote:**
     - In your `WHERE` clause, the condition `country_name = 'Russian Federation\`` is missing the closing single quote after `'Russian Federation`.
     - The correct condition should be:
       ```sql
       WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
       ```

2. **Corrected SQL Query:**

   ```sql
   -- 4. Retrieve all years available for Russia
   SELECT DISTINCT `year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
   WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

---

### **Explanation of Quota Exceeded Error:**

Even after correcting the syntax error, you're likely to continue encountering the **quota exceeded** error. Here's why:

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:**
  - The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of **rows returned** by the query but does **not** limit the amount of **data scanned** during query execution.
  - BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the amount of data **scanned**.

- **Large Dataset Size:**
  - The `international_debt` table is large, and even querying a single column with filters can result in scanning a significant amount of data.
  - Filtering by `country_name` reduces the number of rows but may not sufficiently reduce the data scanned to stay within your quota.

---

### **Possible Solutions:**

To avoid exceeding your quota, consider the following strategies:

1. **Further Reduce Data Scanned:**

   - **Filter by Specific Years:**
     - If you have an idea of a smaller range of years, you can add a condition to limit the years.
     - **Example:**
       ```sql
       WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `year` >= 2015
       ```
     - However, since you're trying to retrieve all available years, this may not help.

   - **Select from a Smaller Table:**
     - Unfortunately, in this case, we are already selecting only one column, and there isn't a smaller table containing the years.

2. **Estimate Available Years Without Querying:**

   - **Known Data Ranges:**
     - The `international_debt` dataset typically covers data from a range of years provided by the World Bank.
     - Considering that the Russian Federation emerged after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, data is likely available from **1992 onwards**.

3. **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

   - **World Bank Data Portal:**
     - Access the [World Bank Data Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/) to retrieve information about available years for Russia without incurring BigQuery data scan charges.
  
---

### **Final Answer in Required Format:**

```csv
Year
year:int
```

Due to data processing quota limitations, we are unable to execute the query to retrieve the exact list of years available for Russia in the `international_debt` dataset.

---

### **Recommendations:**

1. **Enable Billing to Increase Quota:**

   - If possible, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your data processing quota.
   - Be mindful of potential costs associated with processing large datasets.

2. **Use the World Bank API or Data Download:**

   - **World Bank API:**
     - Utilize the [World Bank Indicators API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) to fetch the data you need without the limitations of BigQuery quotas.
     - You can request data for specific countries and indicators over available years.

   - **Data Download:**
     - Download the dataset directly from the World Bank's [Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics).
     - This allows you to work with the data locally without quota restrictions.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Syntax Correction:**
  - Fixed the missing closing quote in your SQL query.

- **Quota Limitations:**
  - Explained why the "Quota exceeded" error occurs even after correcting the syntax.

- **Alternative Solutions:**
  - Suggested accessing the data via the World Bank's resources or enabling billing on your Google Cloud project.

2025-01-20 10:38:05 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:38:05 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering a **"Quota exceeded"** error when executing your SQL query:

```sql
-- 4. Retrieve all years available for Russia
SELECT DISTINCT `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Explanation:**

The **"Quota exceeded"** error occurs because your query is scanning more data than your Google Cloud project's BigQuery free tier allows. BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the amount of data returned.

- **Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is large, containing extensive data across many countries and years.
- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** The `LIMIT` clause limits the number of rows **returned** but does **not** reduce the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.
- **Filtering Limitations:** Even though you're filtering by `country_name`, the way BigQuery stores data may still require scanning a large portion of the table to retrieve the requested data.

---

### **Possible Solutions:**

#### **1. Use a Smaller Table or Alternative Data Source:**

Since querying the `international_debt` table exceeds your quota, consider using a smaller table or alternative source to obtain the available years for Russia.

##### **Option A: Utilize the `country_summary` Table**

Unfortunately, the `country_summary` table does not contain year information.

##### **Option B: Use the World Bank API or Data Portal**

The World Bank provides APIs and data downloads that allow you to access the data you need without BigQuery's quota limitations.

- **World Bank Data Portal:**
  - Visit the [World Bank Data website](https://data.worldbank.org/) to access datasets directly.
  - Download data specific to Russia and international debt indicators.

- **World Bank API:**
  - Utilize the [World Bank Indicators API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation).
  - Example API call to get debt indicators for Russia:
    ```
    https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json
    ```
  - Replace `DT.DOD.DECT.CD` with the desired indicator code.

#### **2. Filter the Data Further in BigQuery:**

If you need to use BigQuery, you can attempt to reduce the amount of data scanned by applying additional filters.

##### **Option A: Filter by Specific Indicator Codes**

If you know specific debt indicator codes, you can include them in your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'  -- Replace with specific code
LIMIT 1000;
```

This reduces the data scanned by focusing on a single indicator.

##### **Option B: Filter by Recent Years**

Limit the query to recent years:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `year` >= 2015
LIMIT 1000;
```

However, since you're trying to retrieve **all years**, this may not fully solve the issue.

#### **3. Enable Billing to Increase Quota:**

To run queries that exceed the free tier quota, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project:

- **Enable Billing:**
  - Upgrade your project to a paid account.
  - This allows for higher data processing quotas.
  - Be cautious of the costs associated with processing large datasets.

---

### **Final Answer:**

Due to data processing quota limitations in BigQuery, we are unable to execute the query to retrieve the exact list of years available for Russia in the `international_debt` dataset.

**As per your required format:**

```csv
Year
year:int (Unable to retrieve years due to quota limitations)
```

---

### **Additional Recommendations:**

- **Use the World Bank's Resources:**
  - The World Bank's data services provide comprehensive access to their datasets without the limitations encountered in BigQuery.
  - This approach allows you to download the data and perform your analysis locally.

- **Optimizing Future Queries:**
  - When working with large datasets in BigQuery, always aim to minimize the amount of data scanned.
  - Select only the necessary columns.
  - Apply as many filters as possible to reduce data scanned.

- **Review Quota Usage:**
  - Check your project's quota usage in the Google Cloud Console.
  - Consider whether other queries or operations have consumed your available quota.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Quota Exceeded Error:** Occurs due to scanning more data than allowed under your current BigQuery free tier quota.
- **Limitations of `LIMIT`:** The `LIMIT` clause does not reduce data scanned, only the number of rows returned.
- **Alternative Solutions:** Use the World Bank Data Portal or API, or enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your quota.
- **Final Answer Format:** Provided as per your instructions, acknowledging the inability to retrieve the data due to quota limitations.

```

is resulting in a quota exceeded error because the `international_debt` table is large, and even with filtering, the amount of data scanned exceeds the free tier quota.

**Alternative Solutions:**

To obtain the required information without exceeding your quota, consider the following options:

1. **Use the World Bank API:**

   - The World Bank offers an API to access their datasets.
   - You can retrieve debt indicators for Russia directly using the API without data processing limitations.
   - Example API call:
     ```
     https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json&per_page=1000
     ```
     - Replace `DT.DOD.DECT.CD` with relevant debt indicator codes.
     - Parse the JSON response to count the number of indicators with a value of 0.

2. **Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - Visit the [World Bank Data website](https://data.worldbank.org/).
   - Search for international debt statistics related to Russia.
   - Download the dataset in CSV or Excel format.
   - Use spreadsheet software or a local database to filter and count the number of debt indicators with a value of 0.

3. **Enable Billing on Google Cloud Platform:**

   - If permissible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your BigQuery quota.
   - Be aware that this may incur costs based on the amount of data processed.
   - Once billing is enabled, you can run the original query to get the exact number.

**Summary:**

Due to limitations with the free tier quota in BigQuery, we're unable to directly retrieve the exact number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0. By utilizing alternative data sources like the World Bank API or downloading the dataset directly, you can perform the necessary analysis without encountering quota issues.

```

Due to data processing quota limitations in BigQuery, we are unable to execute the query to list the distinct indicator codes for Russia from the `international_debt` table.

**Explanation:**

The error you're encountering:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

indicates that your query is scanning more data than allowed under your current BigQuery quota. Even with the `LIMIT` clause, BigQuery processes all data that matches the `WHERE` condition before applying the limit, which can result in exceeding the quota.

**Alternative Solution:**

To address your task—*How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?*—you can consider the following options:

1. **Use the `series_summary` Table:**

   The `series_summary` table contains information about all the indicators available in the dataset. Although it doesn't provide country-specific values, you can retrieve all debt-related indicator codes from this smaller table.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `series_code` AS `indicator_code`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.series_summary`
   WHERE LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   This query should run without exceeding your quota and will provide you with a list of debt-related indicator codes.

2. **Access Data via the World Bank API:**

   You can retrieve the required data directly from the World Bank API without facing quota limitations.

   - **Fetch Debt Indicators for Russia:**

     Access debt indicators for Russia using the following API endpoint:

     ```
     https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator?format=json&per_page=1000
     ```

     - Replace `RU` with `Russian Federation` if needed.
     - You can filter the results to include only debt-related indicators by checking if the indicator name or code includes "debt".
     - Iterate through the data to count the number of indicators with a value of 0, excluding NULL values.

   - **Example Steps:**

     1. Retrieve the data as JSON.
     2. Parse the JSON to extract indicator codes, names, and values.
     3. Filter the records where `value` equals 0 and is not NULL.
     4. Count the distinct indicator codes that meet the criteria.

3. **Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics).
   - Download the dataset related to international debt statistics.
   - Use a tool like Excel, CSV readers, or a local database to perform the query without quota restrictions.

**Final Answer Format:**

As per your requested format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int
```

**Note:** Since we're unable to execute the query due to quota limitations, we cannot provide the exact number. However, by using the alternative methods mentioned above, you can obtain the required information.

**Recommendations:**

- **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

  - If feasible, consider enabling billing to increase your BigQuery data processing quota.
  - This will allow you to run larger queries, but be cautious of potential costs.

- **Use Smaller Datasets or Samples:**

  - If possible, create a reduced version of the dataset that includes only the data for Russia.
  - This can be done by exporting a subset of the data if you have the necessary permissions.

**Summary:**

- The "Quota exceeded" error prevents us from running queries on large tables like `international_debt`.
- Alternative approaches using the `series_summary` table or external resources like the World Bank API can help you obtain the information.
- Enabling billing or working with smaller datasets may also resolve the issue.

2025-01-20 10:40:39 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:40:39 - root - INFO - ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

Due to data processing quota limitations in BigQuery, we are unable to execute the query to determine the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0, excluding NULL values.

**Explanation:**

Your query:

```sql
-- 6. Find records where value is NULL for Russia
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `value` IS NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

is resulting in a **"Quota exceeded"** error because the `international_debt` table is substantial, and even with filtering, the amount of data scanned exceeds the free tier quota.

**Alternative Solutions:**

Since we cannot execute the query directly, here are some steps you can consider to obtain the required information:

1. **Use the World Bank API:**

   - **Access the Data Directly:**
     - Utilize the [World Bank Indicators API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) to retrieve debt indicators for Russia.
     - Example API call to get debt indicators for Russia:
       ```
       https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json&per_page=1000
       ```
     - You can adjust the `indicator code` and parameters as needed to retrieve relevant data.
     - Process the data to count the number of indicators with a value of 0, excluding NULL values.

2. **Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - **Download Datasets:**
     - Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics).
     - Download the international debt statistics datasets in CSV or Excel format.
     - Filter the data locally to find the number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0.

3. **Enable Billing to Increase BigQuery Quota:**

   - **Upgrade Your Project Quota:**
     - If feasible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your data processing quota.
     - Be mindful of potential costs associated with processing large datasets.

**Summary:**

- The exact number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0 cannot be determined due to BigQuery quota limitations.
- Alternative methods, such as using the World Bank API or downloading the dataset directly, can help you obtain the required information without facing quota issues.

**Note:**

- The list of debt-related indicator codes you retrieved (e.g., `DT.DOD.DECT.CD`, `DT.TDS.DECT.CD`, etc.) indicates there are numerous debt indicators available.
- Without accessing the `international_debt` table, we cannot ascertain how many of these indicators have a value of 0 for Russia.

2025-01-20 10:41:20 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:41:20 - root - INFO - ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

**Explanation:**

You're encountering a **"Quota exceeded"** error when running your SQL query:

```sql
-- 6. Find records where value is NULL for Russia
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `value` IS NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Understanding the Issue:**

The **"Quota exceeded"** error occurs because your query scans more data than allowed under your current BigQuery free tier quota. The `international_debt` table is large, and even with filters applied, the amount of data scanned exceeds the quota.

**Why This Happens:**

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** In BigQuery, the `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows **returned** by the query, not the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.
- **Large Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table contains extensive data across many countries, indicators, and years.
- **Filters May Not Suffice:** While filtering by `country_name` and `value`, the overall data scanned remains significant due to the table's size and storage format.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Further Reduce Data Scanned:**

   - **Filter by Specific Years:**

     If you can narrow down the years of interest, you can add a condition to limit the data:

     ```sql
     AND `year` >= 2015  -- Adjust the year as needed
     ```

     However, since you're looking for `NULL` values, which might be distributed across all years, this may not sufficiently reduce the data scanned.

   - **Filter by Specific Indicators:**

     If you have a list of specific debt indicator codes (from your previous query results), you can include them to narrow down the data:

     ```sql
     AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.AMT.DEGG.CD', 'DT.AMT.DEPS.CD', 'DT.AMT.DLTF.CD', '...')  -- Include relevant codes
     ```

     Be aware that including many indicators might still result in scanning large amounts of data.

2. **Use the World Bank API:**

   - **Access Data Directly:**

     Utilize the [World Bank Indicators API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) to retrieve the data you need without the limitations of BigQuery quotas.

     - **Example API Call:**

       Retrieve debt indicators for Russia:

       ```
       https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator?format=json&per_page=1000
       ```

       - Replace `RU` with `Russian Federation` if needed.
       - Filter the results to include only debt-related indicators by checking if the indicator name or code contains "debt".

     - **Steps:**

       1. Fetch the data using the API.
       2. Parse the JSON response.
       3. Filter records where `value` is `0` and exclude `NULL` values.
       4. Count the number of unique debt indicators meeting the criteria.

3. **Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - **Direct Download:**

     Visit the [World Bank Open Data website](https://data.worldbank.org/) and download the international debt dataset.

     - **Steps:**

       1. Download the dataset in CSV or Excel format.
       2. Open the dataset in a spreadsheet application or database tool.
       3. Apply filters for `country_name`, `value = 0`, and exclude `NULL` values.
       4. Count the number of unique debt indicators for Russia.

4. **Enable Billing to Increase BigQuery Quota:**

   - **Upgrade Your Google Cloud Project:**

     If feasible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your BigQuery data processing quota.

     - **Considerations:**

       - This will allow you to run the queries without quota issues.
       - Be mindful of potential costs associated with data processing in BigQuery.
       - Ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs for your use case.

**Conclusion:**

Due to BigQuery's data processing quota limitations, we're unable to execute the query to find the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of `0`, excluding `NULL` values. However, by using alternative methods like the World Bank API or downloading the dataset directly, you can obtain the needed information without facing quota restrictions.

**Final Answer in Required Format:**

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Estimate Before Executing Queries:**

  - In the BigQuery console, you can see an estimate of the amount of data your query will scan before running it.
  - Adjust your query to reduce the estimated data scanned below your quota limit.

- **Sample the Data:**

  - If you only need an approximate answer, consider querying a sample of the data.
  - Use the `TABLESAMPLE` clause if available, or limit your query to a smaller time frame or fewer indicators.

- **Check for Existing Reports:**

  - The World Bank or other financial institutions might have existing reports or datasets summarizing debt indicators for Russia.
  - These resources might already contain the information you need without the need for data processing.

**Note:**

- **Understanding BigQuery Behavior:**

  - Remember that BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data **scanned**, not just the data **returned**.
  - Designing queries to minimize the data scanned is crucial when working within quota limits.

**Feel Free to Ask for Further Assistance:**

2025-01-20 10:41:47 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:41:47 - root - INFO - ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

**Explanation:**

Despite correcting the SQL queries and attempting to optimize them, we're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running queries on the `international_debt` table in the `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt` dataset. This error occurs because the amount of data being scanned exceeds the free tier quota in BigQuery.

**Why We Can't Proceed:**

- **Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is large, and even with filters applied, the data scanned surpasses the quota limits.
- **Limitations of `LIMIT`:** The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows **returned** but does not reduce the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.
- **Quota Restrictions:** Without sufficient quota, we cannot execute the queries needed to retrieve the exact number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0.

**Alternative Approaches:**

To obtain the required information without exceeding your BigQuery quota, consider the following options:

1. **Use the World Bank Data API:**

   - **Access Data Directly:**
     - Utilize the [World Bank API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) to fetch the data.
     - Example API call to retrieve all debt indicators for Russia:
       ```
       https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.*?format=json&per_page=1000
       ```
     - Replace `DT.*` with specific debt indicator codes if known.
   - **Process the Data:**
     - Parse the JSON response to extract indicators where `value` is 0 and not NULL.
     - Count the number of unique debt indicators meeting the criteria.

2. **Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - **Download Datasets:**
     - Visit the [World Bank Open Data Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/) to download the international debt datasets.
     - Choose the data format that suits you (e.g., CSV, Excel).
   - **Analyze Locally:**
     - Use spreadsheet software or a local database to filter records for Russia where the `value` is 0 and not NULL.
     - Count the number of unique debt indicators satisfying the conditions.

3. **Enable Billing to Increase BigQuery Quota:**

   - **Upgrade Your Google Cloud Project:**
     - Enabling billing lifts the quota limits, allowing you to run larger queries.
     - Be mindful of potential costs associated with processing large datasets.
   - **Execute the Queries:**
     - Once the quota is increased, you can rerun the SQL queries to obtain the exact number.

**Summary:**

Due to BigQuery's data processing quota limitations, we cannot execute the necessary queries to determine the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0, excluding NULL values. By utilizing alternative methods such as the World Bank API or downloading the dataset directly, you can perform the required analysis without facing quota restrictions.

Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

**Explanation:**

You're encountering a **"Quota exceeded"** error when running your SQL query:

```sql
-- 7. Find records where value is greater than 0 for Russia
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `value` > 0
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Reason:**

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** The `LIMIT` clause limits the number of rows **returned** but does not reduce the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.
- **Large Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is substantial. Even with filters, the query scans a large amount of data, exceeding your BigQuery free tier quota.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Further Reduce Data Scanned:**

   - **Filter by Year:**
     ```sql
     AND `year` = 2020  -- Specify a specific year to limit data scanned
     ```
     This restricts the query to data from one year, significantly reducing the data scanned.

   - **Filter by Specific Indicators:**
     If you know specific `indicator_code`s, you can filter by them:
     ```sql
     AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.AMT.DLXF.CD')  -- Use relevant codes
     ```

   - **Combine Filters:**
     Limit both the years and indicators:
     ```sql
     AND `year` = 2020
     AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'
     ```

2. **Select Only Necessary Columns:**

   You're already selecting only `indicator_name`, `value`, and `year`, which helps minimize data scanned.

3. **Estimate Data Scanned Before Executing:**

   Use the BigQuery UI to check the estimated bytes processed:

   - Paste your query into the BigQuery query editor.
   - Look for the message indicating how much data will be processed.
   - Adjust your query to bring the estimated data under your quota limit.

4. **Enable Billing to Increase Quota:**

   If possible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your data processing quota. Be cautious of potential costs associated with processing large datasets.

5. **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

   - **World Bank Data Portal:**
     Download the dataset directly from the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/).
   - **World Bank API:**
     Access data using the [World Bank API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation).

**Alternative Query Example:**

Here's how you might modify your query to reduce data scanned:

```sql
-- 7. Find records where value is greater than 0 for Russia in 2020
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` > 0
  AND `year` = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** By adding `AND year = 2020`, you significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Conclusion:**

Due to BigQuery's data processing quota limitations, we cannot execute the query as it stands. By refining your query to scan less data or using alternative methods, you may obtain the required information without exceeding your quota.

```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Why This Error Occurs:**

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** In BigQuery, the `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows **returned** by the query but does **not** limit the amount of data **scanned** during execution. Charges and quotas are based on the data scanned.

- **Large Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is substantial, and even with filters applied, the query scans a significant amount of data, exceeding your project's quota.

---

### **Possible Solutions:**

FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` > 0
  AND `year` = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Filter by Specific Indicators:**

If you know specific debt indicator codes, include them to narrow down the data.

```sql
-- Limit to a specific debt indicator
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` > 0
  AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'  -- Replace with relevant code
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Combine Filters:**

Combining filters can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.

```sql
-- Combine year and indicator code filters
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` > 0
  AND `year` = 2020
  AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'  -- Replace with relevant code
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **2. Estimate Data Scanned Before Running the Query**

- **Use the BigQuery UI:**

2025-01-20 10:44:17 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still receiving a **"Quota exceeded"** error when running your SQL query:

```sql
-- 7. Find records where value is greater than 0 for Russia
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `value` > 0
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Explanation:**

The **"Quota exceeded"** error occurs because your query is scanning more data than your Google Cloud project's BigQuery free tier allows. BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the amount of data returned.

- **Limitations of `LIMIT`:** The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows **returned** but does **not** limit the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.

- **Large Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is substantial, containing extensive data across many countries, indicators, and years. Even with some filters applied, the query may still process more data than your quota permits.

---

### **Possible Solutions:**

#### **1. Further Reduce Data Scanned by Adding More Filters**

To decrease the amount of data scanned and stay within your quota, you can add additional filters to your query:

**Filter by Specific Year(s):**

Limiting your query to a specific year or a smaller range of years can significantly reduce the data scanned.

```sql
-- Filter for the year 2020
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` > 0
  AND `year` = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Filter by Specific Indicator(s):**

If you know certain indicator codes related to debt, you can include them in your `WHERE` clause.

```sql
-- Filter for specific indicator codes
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` > 0
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.AMT.DLXF.CD')  -- Replace with relevant codes
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Combine Filters:**

Combining multiple filters narrows down the dataset further.

```sql
-- Combine year and indicator filters
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` > 0
  AND `year` = 2020
  AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'  -- Replace with a relevant code
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Filtering by Year:** Reduces the number of rows processed by focusing on data from a specific year.
- **Filtering by Indicator Code:** Targets specific indicators, further reducing data volume.
- **Combining Filters:** Maximizes the reduction in data scanned.

#### **2. Use Estimated Query Data to Adjust Your Query**

Before running your query, you can check the estimated amount of data it will scan:

- **In the BigQuery Console:**
  - Paste your query into the query editor.
  - Look for the message indicating "This query will process XX MB when run."
  - Adjust your query filters until the estimated data scanned is below your quota limit.

#### **3. Enable Billing to Increase Your Quota**

If reducing the data scanned isn't sufficient or feasible, consider enabling billing for your project:

- **Enable Billing:**
  - Upgrading your project to a paid account increases your data processing quota.
  - **Caution:** Ensure you understand the associated costs before enabling billing.
  - **Billing Information:** [BigQuery Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing)

#### **4. Use Alternative Data Sources**

If running the query within BigQuery isn't possible, you can obtain the data through other means:

**World Bank API:**

- **Access Data via API:**
  - Utilize the [World Bank API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) to retrieve the data without BigQuery's limitations.
  - **Example API Call:**
    ```
    https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json&per_page=1000
    ```
    - Replace `DT.DOD.DECT.CD` with relevant indicator codes.
- **Process Data Locally:**
  - Parse the JSON response.
  - Filter records where `value` > 0.
  - Analyze the data as needed.

**Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal:**

- **Direct Download:**
  - Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/).
  - Download the "International Debt Statistics" dataset in CSV or Excel format.
- **Analyze Locally:**
  - Use spreadsheet software or a database tool.
  - Apply filters for `country_name`, `value`, `indicator_code`, etc.
  - Perform your analysis without quota restrictions.

---

### **Final Answer in Required Format:**

Due to data processing quota limitations, we cannot execute the query to retrieve the required data using BigQuery. Therefore, we cannot provide the exact number of debt indicators for Russia with a value greater than 0.

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

---

### **Summary:**

- **Issue:** The query exceeds your project's BigQuery data processing quota.
- **Solutions:**
  - **Add More Filters:** Reduce data scanned by filtering by year and indicator codes.
  - **Estimate Data Scanned:** Use the BigQuery UI to adjust your query before execution.
  - **Enable Billing:** Increase your quota by enabling billing, being mindful of costs.
  - **Alternative Sources:** Use the World Bank API or download data directly for local analysis.

2025-01-20 10:46:06 - root - INFO - ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

**Explanation:**

You're encountering a **"Quota exceeded"** error when trying to execute your SQL query:

```sql
-- 9. Find indicators related to debt for Russia
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Understanding the Issue:**

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** In BigQuery, the `LIMIT` clause limits the number of rows **returned** but does **not** limit the amount of data **scanned** during query execution. Charges and quotas are based on the data scanned.

- **Large Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is substantial. Even with filters like `country_name` and `indicator_name`, the query may scan a significant amount of data, exceeding your project's free tier quota.

---

### **Possible Solutions:**

#### **1. Reduce Data Scanned by Adding More Specific Filters**

**Filter by Year:**

Adding a condition to filter by a specific year can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.

```sql
-- Find debt-related indicators for Russia in a specific year
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace 2020 with the desired year
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Filter by Specific Indicator Codes:**

If you know specific debt-related indicator codes, you can use them to narrow down the data.

```sql
-- Find specific debt-related indicators for Russia
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')  -- Replace with relevant codes
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Combine Filters:**

Combining multiple filters can further reduce the data scanned.

```sql
-- Combine filters to minimize data scanned
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')  -- Replace with relevant codes
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace with the desired year
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **2. Use the `series_summary` Table**

The `series_summary` table contains information about all indicators and is much smaller. You can retrieve debt-related indicators from this table without exceeding your quota.

```sql
-- Find all debt-related indicators
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.series_summary`
WHERE LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** This query provides a list of debt-related indicators but does not include country-specific data.

#### **3. Utilize the World Bank API**

You can access the required data using the World Bank API, which allows you to retrieve specific data without BigQuery's limitations.

- **API Endpoint Example:**

  ```
  https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator?format=json&per_page=1000
  ```

- **Instructions:**

  - Use the API to fetch debt-related indicators for Russia.
  - Parse the JSON response to extract indicator names and values.
  - Filter indicators where the value is 0 and not NULL.

#### **4. Download Data for Local Analysis**

Download the dataset directly from the World Bank Data Catalog and analyze it locally.

- **Steps:**

  1. Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics).
  2. Download the "International Debt Statistics" dataset.
  3. Use spreadsheet software or a local database to filter and analyze the data without quota restrictions.

#### **5. Enable Billing to Increase Your BigQuery Quota**

If feasible, you can enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your data processing quota.

- **Considerations:**

  - Enabling billing may incur costs based on the amount of data processed.
  - Ensure you understand the pricing and monitor your usage carefully.

---

### **Conclusion**

Due to BigQuery's data processing quota limitations, we cannot execute the query as it stands to obtain the exact number of debt indicators for Russia. By refining your query to scan less data or using alternative methods like the World Bank API or downloading the dataset for local analysis, you can obtain the required information without exceeding your quota.

---

**Additional Assistance:**

- **Estimating Data Scanned:**

  - In the BigQuery console, you can see an estimate of the amount of data your query will scan before running it.
  - Adjust your query filters until the estimated data scanned is within your quota limit.

- **Alternative Datasets:**

  - Explore other tables in the `bigquery-public-data` dataset that might offer the required information in a smaller size.

- **Contact Support:**

  - If accessing this data is critical and other options are not viable, consider contacting Google Cloud Support for assistance with quota adjustments.

2025-01-20 10:46:57 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:46:57 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering a **"Quota exceeded"** error when executing your SQL query:

```sql
-- 9. Find indicators related to debt for Russia
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Explanation:**

The error occurs because your query is scanning more data than allowed under your project's BigQuery free tier quota. The `international_debt` table is quite large, and even with filters, the amount of data scanned exceeds the limit. The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows **returned** but does **not** reduce the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.

---

### **Possible Solutions:**

#### **1. Use a Smaller Table (`series_summary`):**

You can use the `series_summary` table, which contains metadata about the indicators, to find debt-related indicators without exceeding your quota.

```sql
-- Find debt-related indicators from the series_summary table
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.series_summary`
WHERE LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query should run within your quota limits as the `series_summary` table is significantly smaller. However, note that this table does not contain country-specific data, so you'll get a list of all debt-related indicators available in the dataset.

#### **2. Reduce Data Scanned by Adding More Filters:**

If you need to use the `international_debt` table, you can reduce the amount of data scanned by applying additional filters.

- **Filter by Year:**

  ```sql
  -- Find debt-related indicators for Russia in a specific year
  SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
  WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
    AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
    AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace 2020 with the desired year
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

  Filtering by a specific year reduces the number of rows processed, lowering the data scanned.

- **Filter by Specific Indicators:**

  If you have specific indicator codes, you can include them in your query:

  ```sql
  -- Find specific debt-related indicators for Russia
  SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
  WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
    AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')  -- Replace with relevant codes
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

- **Combine Filters:**

  Combining multiple filters can further reduce the data scanned:

  ```sql
  -- Combine filters to minimize data scanned
  SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_name`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
  WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
    AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
    AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace with desired year
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

#### **3. Estimate Data Scanned Before Running the Query:**

In the BigQuery console, you can see an estimate of the data size your query will process before running it. Adjust your query to ensure the estimated data scanned is within your quota.

#### **4. Use Alternative Data Sources:**

- **World Bank API:**

  Access the data directly using the World Bank API, which allows you to retrieve the required information without BigQuery's limitations.

  **Example API Call:**

  ```
  https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator?format=json&per_page=1000
  ```

  Parse the JSON response to extract debt-related indicators for Russia.

- **Download Data for Local Analysis:**

  Download the dataset from the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics) and analyze it locally using spreadsheet software or a database tool, which bypasses BigQuery's quota restrictions.

#### **5. Enable Billing to Increase Your Quota:**

If acceptable, enabling billing on your Google Cloud project increases your data processing quota, allowing you to run larger queries. Be aware that this may incur costs based on the amount of data processed.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Due to the data processing quota limitations, the query cannot be executed as it currently stands. By using the `series_summary` table or refining your query to reduce the data scanned, you can obtain the information without exceeding your quota. Alternatively, consider using the World Bank API or downloading the data for local analysis.

LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Alternative Solution Using the `series_summary` Table**

Given the limitations with querying the `international_debt` table, you can use the `series_summary` table, which is much smaller and contains details about all indicators, including debt-related ones.

**Step 1: Retrieve Debt-Related Indicators**

You can fetch the list of debt-related indicators from the `series_summary` table without exceeding your quota:

```sql
SELECT `series_code` AS `indicator_code`, `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.series_summary`
WHERE LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query will provide you with a list of debt-related indicator codes and their names.

**Example Output:**

| indicator_code    | indicator_name                                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| DT.DOD.DECT.CD    | External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$)     |
| DT.TDS.DECT.CD    | Debt service on external debt, total (TDS, current US$) |
| ...               | ...                                                |

---

### **Step 2: Use the World Bank API to Retrieve Data for Russia**

Since querying the `international_debt` table directly isn't feasible due to quota limits, you can use the World Bank API to get the data for Russia.

**World Bank API Endpoint Format:**

```
https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/{country_code}/indicator/{indicator_code}?format=json&per_page=1000
```

**For Russia, the country code is `RU`.**

**Example API Call:**

```plaintext
https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json&per_page=1000
```

**Steps:**

1. **Iterate Over Indicator Codes:**

   - Use the list of `indicator_code`s obtained from the `series_summary` table.
   - For each indicator code, make an API request.

2. **Fetch Data:**

   - Retrieve the JSON response, which includes data for Russia across different years.

3. **Process Data:**

   - For each indicator, parse the response to extract the `value` for each year.
   - Count the number of indicators where the `value` is `0`, excluding `null` values.

**Example Script Outline (Python):**

```python
import requests

indicator_codes = ['DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD', ...]  # Add all indicator codes
zero_value_indicators = set()

for code in indicator_codes:
    url = f"https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/{code}?format=json&per_page=1000"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    
    if len(data) > 1:
        entries = data[1]
        for entry in entries:
            value = entry.get('value')
            if value == 0:
                zero_value_indicators.add(code)
                break  # No need to check other years for this indicator

print(f"Number of Debt Indicators with Value 0: {len(zero_value_indicators)}")
```

**Note:**

- The script fetches data for each indicator and checks if there's any year where the `value` is `0`.
- It counts the unique indicators that meet the criteria.

---

### **Advantages of Using the World Bank API:**

- **No Quota Issues:** Avoids BigQuery's data scanning quotas.
- **Up-to-Date Data:** Retrieves the most recent data available from the World Bank.
- **Specific to Russia:** Directly queries data for the Russian Federation.

---

### **Alternative: Download Data for Offline Analysis**

You can download the international debt data from the World Bank and analyze it locally.

**Steps:**

1. **Download Data:**

   - Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/international-debt-statistics).
   - Download the "International Debt Statistics" dataset in CSV or Excel format.

2. **Filter Data:**

   - Open the dataset in your preferred data analysis tool (e.g., Excel, Python, R).
   - Filter records where:
     - `Country Code` is `RUS`.
     - `Indicator Name` contains `debt`.
     - `Value` is `0`.
     - `Value` is not `null`.

3. **Count Debt Indicators:**

   - Count the number of unique `Indicator Code`s that meet the criteria.

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue:** Unable to execute queries on the `international_debt` table due to quota limitations.
- **Solution:** Use the smaller `series_summary` table to obtain debt-related indicator codes.
- **Data Retrieval:** Utilize the World Bank API or download datasets for offline analysis.
- **Outcome:** Determine the number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of `0`, excluding `null` values.

Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Unable to determine exact number due to quota limitations)
```

**Explanation:**

Your query:

```sql
SELECT `year`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'
LIMIT 1000;
```

is resulting in a **"Quota exceeded"** error:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

This happens because:

- **Large Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is substantial, containing extensive data across many countries, indicators, and years.
- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** The `LIMIT` clause limits the number of rows **returned** but does **not** reduce the amount of data **scanned**. BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.
- **Quota Limitations:** Your Google Cloud project has a limited quota for data processing under the free tier.

**Alternative Solutions:**

To obtain the required data without exceeding your quota, consider the following options:

1. **Use the World Bank API:**

   - **Access Data Directly:**
     - Utilize the [World Bank API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) to retrieve the data without BigQuery's limitations.
     - **API Endpoint for Your Indicator:**
       ```
       https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json&per_page=1000
       ```
       - Replace `RU` with `Russian Federation` if needed.
       - `DT.DOD.DECT.CD` is the indicator code for **External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$)**.
   - **Process the Data:**
     - The API returns data in JSON format.
     - Parse the JSON response to extract the `year` and `value` fields.
     - You can use programming languages like Python or tools like Postman to make API requests and process the data.

2. **Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - **Direct Download:**
     - Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/international-debt-statistics).
     - Download the **International Debt Statistics** dataset in CSV or Excel format.
   - **Analyze Locally:**
     - Use spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel) or data analysis tools (e.g., Python, R) to open the dataset.
     - Filter the data for:
       - `Country Name` or `Country Code` matching **Russian Federation** or **RUS**.
       - `Indicator Code` matching **DT.DOD.DECT.CD**.
     - Extract the `year` and `value` columns for your analysis.

3. **Enable Billing to Increase BigQuery Quota:**

   - **Upgrade Your Google Cloud Project:**
     - Enabling billing on your project removes the free tier limitations and increases your data processing quota.
     - **Caution:** This will incur costs based on the amount of data processed.
     - Ensure you understand the [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) before proceeding.
   - **After Enabling Billing:**
     - You can execute your original query without encountering quota errors.

**Final Notes:**

- **Why the Error Occurs:**
  - Even though you're selecting data for a specific country and indicator, BigQuery may still scan large amounts of data due to how the data is stored and partitioned.
  - The dataset might not be optimized for such selective queries under the free tier quotas.

- **Using Alternative Methods:**
  - The World Bank API and data downloads are excellent resources that allow you to access the data you need without the constraints of BigQuery quotas.
  - These methods are suitable for fetching data for specific countries and indicators, especially when dealing with limited data volumes.

**Conclusion:**

Due to BigQuery's data processing quota limitations, we cannot execute the query to retrieve the values for the specific debt indicator code **'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'** for Russia using BigQuery. However, by utilizing the World Bank API or downloading the dataset directly for offline analysis, you can obtain the required information without facing quota restrictions.

2025-01-20 10:48:50 - root - INFO - ```csv
Year,Value
year:int,value:float
(Data retrieval not possible due to quota limitations)
```

**Explanation:**

You're encountering a **"Quota exceeded"** error when trying to execute your SQL query:

```sql
-- 10. Retrieve values for a specific debt indicator code for Russia
SELECT `year`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation' AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Reason:**

This error occurs because, even with filters applied, the amount of data scanned by the query exceeds your BigQuery free tier quota. The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows **returned** but does not limit the amount of data **scanned** during query execution. The `international_debt` table is large, and querying it can quickly surpass free tier limits.

---

**Alternative Solution Using the World Bank API:**

To retrieve the values for the specific debt indicator code `DT.DOD.DECT.CD` (External debt stocks, total) for Russia without facing quota issues, you can use the World Bank API.

2025-01-20 10:49:49 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:49:49 - root - INFO - I see that you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when executing your SQL query:

```sql
-- 10. Retrieve values for a specific debt indicator code for Russia
SELECT `year`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`

LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Explanation**

The error occurs because your query is scanning more data than allowed under your project's BigQuery free tier quota. The `LIMIT` clause limits the number of rows **returned** but does **not** limit the amount of data **scanned** during query execution. Even though you're filtering by country and indicator code, the `international_debt` table is quite large, and scanning it can exceed the free tier limits.

---

### **Alternative Solutions**

#### **1. Use the World Bank API**

Accessing the data through the World Bank API allows you to retrieve the information without encountering BigQuery quota limitations.

**Steps to Retrieve Data Using the World Bank API:**

1. **Construct the API URL:**

   ```
   https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json&per_page=1000
   ```

   - **`RU`** is the ISO country code for Russia.
   - **`DT.DOD.DECT.CD`** is the indicator code for **External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$)**.
   - **`format=json`** specifies the response format.
   - **`per_page=1000`** ensures that all data points are retrieved.

2. **Access the API:**

   - Open the URL in a web browser, or use a tool like `curl`, `wget`, or Postman.

     ```

3. **Parse the JSON Response:**

   - The response is a JSON array with two elements.
     - The first element contains metadata.
     - The second element contains the data records.
   - Each data record includes:
     - **`date`**: The year.
     - **`value`**: The indicator value for that year.

4. **Extract the Data:**

   - Use a programming language like Python to parse and extract the data.

   **Python Example:**

   ```python
   import requests
   import json

   # API URL
   url = "https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json&per_page=1000"

   # Fetch data from API
   response = requests.get(url)
   data = response.json()

   # Check if data is available
   if len(data) > 1:
       records = data[1]  # Data records
       # Extract Year and Value
       for record in records:
           year = record['date']
           value = record['value']
           print(f"Year: {year}, Value: {value}")
   else:
       print("No data available.")
   ```

   **Sample Output:**

   ```
   Year: 2021, Value: 478932000000
   Year: 2020, Value: 470128000000
   Year: 2019, Value: 464815000000
   ...
   ```

   *Please note that these values are for illustration purposes. Fetch the data using the API to get the actual values.*

5. **Save Data to CSV (Optional):**

   To save the extracted data to a CSV file, you can modify the script:

   ```python
   import csv

   with open('russia_external_debt.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
       fieldnames = ['Year', 'Value']
       writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
       writer.writeheader()

       for record in records:
           year = record['date']
           value = record['value']
           writer.writerow({'Year': year, 'Value': value})
   ```

#### **2. Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal**

You can download the dataset directly from the World Bank website and analyze it without BigQuery limitations.

**Steps:**

1. **Visit the Indicator Page:**

   - [External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?locations=RU)

2. **Download the Data:**

   - Click on the **“Download”** button.
   - Choose **“CSV”** or **“EXCEL”** as the format.

3. **Open and Analyze the Data:**

   - Use spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
   - The data will include years and corresponding values for Russia.

**Sample Data Format:**

| Year | Value           |
|------|-----------------|
| 2021 | 478,932,000,000 |
| 2020 | 470,128,000,000 |
| 2019 | 464,815,000,000 |
| ...  | ...             |

#### **3. Optimize Your BigQuery Query**

If you prefer to use BigQuery, you can try to optimize the query to reduce the data scanned.

**Use Partitioning to Reduce Data Scanned:**

If the `international_debt` table is partitioned by year, you can limit the query to specific partitions.

**Example Query with Year Filter:**

```sql
SELECT `year`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Specify a particular year
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:**
- Filtering by a specific year reduces the amount of data scanned.
- Check the estimated bytes to be processed before running the query.

**Check the Estimated Data Scanned:**

- In the BigQuery UI, paste your query.
- Look for the message that says **“This query will process XX MB when run.”**
- Ensure the estimated data is within your quota limits.

**If the estimated data is still too high:**

- Try narrowing down the range of years.
- Select only necessary columns.
- Consider querying a smaller table or dataset if available.

---

### **Final Recommendation**

Given the constraints with BigQuery quotas, the most efficient way to retrieve the data is through the **World Bank API** or by **downloading the dataset** directly from the World Bank’s website. These methods bypass BigQuery limitations and allow you to access the exact data you need.

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue:** Quota exceeded when querying BigQuery dataset.
- **Solution:**
  - Use the **World Bank API** to fetch the data programmatically.
  - Download the data from the **World Bank Data Portal** for offline analysis.
  - Optimize the BigQuery query to reduce data scanned (may still exceed quota).
- **Outcome:** Retrieve the values for the debt indicator code **`DT.DOD.DECT.CD`** for Russia without exceeding quotas.

2025-01-20 10:50:37 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the SQL fragment starting with `AND` without a preceding `WHERE` clause or preceding conditions. In SQL, `AND` is used to combine conditions within a `WHERE` clause and cannot be used at the beginning of a statement.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's how you can include the year filter in your query:

```sql
-- 10. Retrieve values for a specific debt indicator code for Russia for the year 2020
SELECT `year`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace 2020 with the desired year
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- The `AND` condition must be part of a `WHERE` clause in a complete SQL query.
- The `WHERE` clause begins with `WHERE` and is followed by one or more conditions.
- Each additional condition is connected using `AND` or `OR`.
- In the corrected query, the `year` filter is properly included within the `WHERE` clause.

**Note:**

- Due to data processing quota limitations in BigQuery, executing this query may still result in a **"Quota exceeded"** error.
- To minimize data scanned and stay within your quota:

  - **Select Only Necessary Columns:** You're already selecting only `year` and `value`, which helps.
  - **Apply Specific Filters:** Filtering by `country_name`, `indicator_code`, and `year` reduces the amount of data scanned.
  - **Check Estimated Data Scanned:** In the BigQuery UI, you can see an estimate of the data to be processed before running the query.

**Alternative Solution:**

If you continue to experience quota errors, consider using the **World Bank API** or downloading the data directly:

- **World Bank API:**

  ```plaintext
  https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json&date=2020&per_page=100
  ```

  - Replace `2020` with the desired year.
  - Fetches data for the specified indicator and year for Russia.

- **Download Data:**

  - Visit the [World Bank Data Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?locations=RU).
  - Download the data in CSV or Excel format.
  - Analyze the data locally without quota limitations.

2025-01-20 10:51:25 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:51:25 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because the SQL fragment you've provided is incomplete and cannot be executed on its own. The `AND` condition cannot start a new SQL statement; it must be part of a `WHERE` clause in a complete `SELECT` query.

Additionally, even after correcting the syntax, you may still face the **"Quota exceeded"** error due to BigQuery's data processing limits. Below, I'll provide the corrected SQL query and suggest alternative methods to obtain the data you need without exceeding your quota.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

To include the year filter in your query, you need to integrate it into the existing `WHERE` clause of your SELECT statement:

```sql
-- 10. Retrieve values for a specific debt indicator code for Russia for the year 2020
SELECT `year`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace 2020 with the desired year
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`WHERE` Clause:** The `WHERE` clause begins with `WHERE` and includes all conditions connected by `AND` or `OR`.
- **`AND` Conditions:** Each condition after the initial `WHERE` is connected with `AND`.
- **Filter by Year:** The condition `AND \`year\` = 2020` filters the data to include only records from the year 2020.

---

**Addressing the "Quota Exceeded" Error:**

Even with the corrected query, the **"Quota exceeded"** error may persist because the amount of data scanned exceeds your BigQuery free tier quota. Here's how you can try to minimize the data scanned:

1. **Estimate Data Scanned Before Running the Query:**

   - In the BigQuery UI, after entering your query, look for the message indicating how much data the query will process.
   - Example: *"This query will process 1.2 MB when run."*
   - Ensure that the estimated data processed is within your quota limits.

2. **Limit Data Scanned by Using Partitioning (If Applicable):**

   - If the table is partitioned by `year`, BigQuery can optimize the query to scan less data.
   - Including the `AND \`year\` = 2020` condition helps reduce the data scanned.

3. **Select Only Necessary Columns:**

   - You're already selecting only `year` and `value`, which helps minimize data processed.

4. **Further Narrow Down the Data (If Possible):**

   - If there are additional filters you can apply (e.g., specific months if the data includes monthly records), include them.

---

**Alternative Methods to Obtain the Data:**

Given the persistent quota issue, you might consider alternative ways to access the required data.

### **1. Use the World Bank API:**

The World Bank API allows you to retrieve data directly without BigQuery quotas.

**API Endpoint for Your Request:**

```
https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?date=2020&format=json
```

**Steps to Retrieve Data:**

- **Send a Request:** Access the URL in a web browser or use a tool like `curl` or `wget`.
- **Parse the Response:** The API returns data in JSON format. You can parse it using a programming language like Python.

**Python Example:**

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?date=2020&format=json"
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

if len(data) > 1:
    records = data[1]
    for record in records:
        year = record['date']
        value = record['value']
        print(f"Year: {year}, Value: {value}")
else:
    print("No data available.")
```

**Output:**

```
Year: 2020, Value: [Debt Value]
```

*Note: Replace `[Debt Value]` with the actual value returned by the API.*

---

### **2. Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal:**

**Steps:**

1. **Visit the Data Portal:**

2025-01-20 10:52:23 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering two issues when trying to execute your SQL fragment:

1. **Syntax Error:**
   - The SQL fragment starting with `AND` cannot be executed on its own because it's incomplete.
   - The `AND` keyword must be used within a `WHERE` clause as part of a complete SQL statement.

2. **Quota Exceeded Error:**
   - Even with the correct syntax, if your query scans more data than allowed under your BigQuery free tier quota, you'll receive a "Quota exceeded" error.

---

### **Corrected SQL Query**

To include the year filter in your query, integrate it into your existing `WHERE` clause. Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
-- Retrieve values for a specific debt indicator code for Russia for the year 2020
SELECT `year`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace 2020 with the desired year
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Syntax Correction:**
  - The `AND` condition must be part of a `WHERE` clause. You cannot start a new SQL statement with `AND`.
  - The corrected query includes the `year` filter within the `WHERE` clause.

- **Quota Exceeded Issue:**
  - BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data **scanned**, not just the amount of data **returned**.
  - Even with filters applied, the query may still scan more data than your quota allows.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

1. **Estimate Data Scanned Before Running the Query:**

   - **Check Estimated Data:**
     - In the BigQuery UI, paste your query into the query editor.
     - Look for the message indicating how much data the query will process (e.g., "This query will process 10 MB when run.").
     - Ensure that the estimated data scanned is within your quota limits.

2. **Further Reduce Data Scanned:**

   - **Limit to Specific Years:**
     - You've already filtered by `year = 2020`, which helps reduce data scanned.
   - **Select Only Necessary Columns:**
     - You're selecting only `year` and `value`, minimizing data processed.
   - **Additional Filters:**
     - If possible, add more specific filters to narrow down the data.

3. **Use the World Bank API:**

   - **Access Data Directly:**
     - Utilize the World Bank API to retrieve the data without BigQuery's limitations.
     - **API Endpoint:**
       ```
       https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?date=2020&format=json
       ```
     - **Instructions:**
       - Access the URL in a web browser or use a tool like `curl` or a programming language like Python.
       - Parse the JSON response to extract the `year` and `value`.

4. **Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal:**

2025-01-20 10:53:08 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:53:08 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a syntax issue in your SQL statement. Specifically, you're attempting to execute a fragment that starts with `AND` without it being part of a complete `SELECT` statement. In SQL, the `AND` operator is used to combine conditions within a `WHERE` clause and cannot start a new query on its own.

---

### **Explanation of the Error:**

- **Unexpected `AND` Keyword:**
  - The SQL parser expects `AND` to appear after an initial condition in a `WHERE` clause.
  - Starting a statement with `AND` without a preceding `WHERE` clause or condition leads to a syntax error.
- **Error Message Details:**
  - **Syntax error:** Indicates there is something wrong with the structure of your SQL query.
  - **Unexpected keyword `AND` at [2:1]:** At line 2, character 1, the parser found an `AND` where it didn't expect one.

---

### **Correcting the SQL Statement:**

To fix the error, you need to incorporate the `AND` condition into a complete `SELECT` statement within a `WHERE` clause. Here is how you can modify your query:

#### **Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Retrieve values for specific debt indicator codes for Russia
SELECT `year`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')  -- Replace with relevant codes
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`SELECT` Clause:**
  - Specifies the columns you want to retrieve (`year` and `value`).
- **`FROM` Clause:**
  - Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
- **`WHERE` Clause:**
  - Begins with the `WHERE` keyword.
  - Contains all conditions combined using `AND` or `OR`.
- **`AND` Conditions:**
  - Used to add additional filters to your query.
  - Must be part of the `WHERE` clause, not standalone.

---

### **Including the Filter in an Existing Query:**

If you're adding the indicator code filter to an existing query, make sure it's integrated properly:

```sql
-- Existing query with additional indicator code filter
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` > 0
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')  -- Replace with relevant codes
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **Addressing the "Quota Exceeded" Error:**

Even after correcting the syntax, you may still encounter the **"Quota exceeded"** error. This occurs because:

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:**
  - BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data **scanned**, not just the data **returned**.
  - Applying `LIMIT` affects the number of rows returned but not the data scanned.
- **Large Dataset Size:**
  - The `international_debt` table is substantial, and even with filters, the data scanned might exceed your quota.

---

### **Possible Solutions to Reduce Data Scanned:**

#### **1. Add a Year Filter to Narrow Down Data:**

Including a specific year in your `WHERE` clause can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.

```sql
-- Adding a year filter to reduce data scanned
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace 2020 with the desired year
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **2. Check Estimated Data Scanned:**

- **Before Running the Query:**
  - In the BigQuery UI, paste your complete query.
  - Look for the message indicating the estimated amount of data the query will process.
  - Ensure it is within your quota limits.

#### **3. Select Only Necessary Columns:**

- Limit your `SELECT` statement to only the columns you need.
- This reduces the amount of data processed.

#### **4. Use the `series_summary` Table (If Applicable):**

- **Smaller Table:**
  - The `series_summary` table is much smaller and contains metadata about indicators.
- **Example Query:**

  ```sql
  -- Get indicator codes for debt-related indicators
  SELECT `series_code` AS `indicator_code`, `indicator_name`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.series_summary`
  WHERE LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

---

### **Alternative Methods to Obtain Data:**

#### **1. Use the World Bank API:**

**Advantages:**

- **No BigQuery Quota Limits:**
  - Fetch data directly without worrying about data scanned.
- **Up-to-Date Data:**
  - Access the most recent data available.

**Example API Call:**

```plaintext
https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?format=json&per_page=1000
```

**Instructions:**

- Replace `DT.DOD.DECT.CD` with the desired indicator codes.
- Use a programming language (e.g., Python) or tools like Postman to make the API requests.
- Parse the JSON response to extract the required data.

#### **2. Download Data Directly:**

**Steps:**

1. **Visit the World Bank Data Catalog:**

   - [International Debt Statistics](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics)

2. **Download the Dataset:**

   - Choose a format (e.g., CSV, Excel).

3. **Filter and Analyze Locally:**

   - Use spreadsheet software or a local database.
   - Filter data for `country_name = 'Russian Federation'` and desired `indicator_code`s.

---

### **Final Recommendations:**

- **Correct Your SQL Syntax:**
  - Ensure your `AND` conditions are within a `WHERE` clause in a complete query.
- **Monitor Data Scanned:**
  - Use the BigQuery UI to estimate data processed before running queries.
- **Consider Quota Limitations:**
  - If your query still exceeds the quota, use alternative methods.
- **Use Alternative Data Sources:**
  - Access data through the World Bank API or by downloading datasets directly.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Error Cause:**
  - Starting a query with `AND` results in a syntax error.
- **Solution:**
  - Incorporate the `AND` condition into a complete `SELECT` query within the `WHERE` clause.
- **Quota Issues:**
  - Even with correct syntax, data scanning limits may prevent query execution.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Use the World Bank API or download data to bypass BigQuery quotas.

2025-01-20 10:53:53 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to two issues:

1. **Syntax Error:** The SQL fragment you're attempting to execute starts with `AND`, which cannot begin a SQL statement.
2. **Quota Exceeded Error:** Even if the syntax is corrected, your query may still scan more data than allowed under your BigQuery free tier quota, resulting in a "Quota exceeded" error.

---

### **1. Syntax Error Explanation and Correction**

**Problem:**
- Starting a statement with `AND` without a preceding condition or `WHERE` clause leads to a syntax error.
- The SQL parser expects `AND` to appear after an initial condition within a `WHERE` clause.

**Solution:**
- Integrate the `AND` condition into a complete `SELECT` statement within a `WHERE` clause.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Retrieve records for specific debt indicator codes for Russia
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')  -- Replace with relevant codes
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**
- **`SELECT` Clause:** Specifies the columns to retrieve.
- **`FROM` Clause:** Indicates the table to query.
- **`WHERE` Clause:** Begins with `WHERE` and includes all conditions.
  - **First Condition:** `country_name = 'Russian Federation'`
  - **Second Condition:** `indicator_code` is in the specified list.
- **`LIMIT`:** Limits the number of rows returned to 1,000.

---

### **2. Quota Exceeded Error Explanation and Solutions**

**Problem:**
- Even with the correct syntax, you're receiving a "Quota exceeded" error because your query scans more data than your BigQuery free tier quota allows.
- **BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned.

**Solutions:**

#### **A. Reduce Data Scanned by Adding More Filters**

To minimize the data scanned, you can add additional filters:

**Include a Year Filter:**

```sql
-- Retrieve records for specific debt indicator codes for Russia in 2020
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace 2020 with the desired year
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**
- Adding `AND \`year\` = 2020` further narrows down the data, reducing the amount scanned.

**Check Estimated Data Scanned Before Running the Query:**

- In the BigQuery UI:
  - Paste your query into the editor.
  - Look for the estimated data to be processed (e.g., "This query will process 10 MB when run").
  - Ensure it is within your quota limits (the free tier allows up to 1 TB per month).

#### **B. Select Only Necessary Columns**

Ensure you're only selecting the columns you need:

```sql
-- Select only the 'value' column if that's all you need
SELECT `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')
  AND `year` = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **C. Use Partitioned Tables (If Applicable)**

- If the table is partitioned by `year`, BigQuery can optimize the query to scan less data.
- By filtering on the partitioned column (`year`), you reduce the data scanned.

---

### **3. Alternative Methods to Obtain the Data**

If you're still encountering quota issues, consider using alternative methods to access the data.

#### **A. Use the World Bank API**

**Advantages:**
- Access data without BigQuery quotas.
- Retrieve up-to-date data directly from the source.

**Example API Call:**

```plaintext
https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?date=2020&format=json&per_page=1000
```

**Steps:**
1. **Access the API:**
   - Use a web browser or tools like `curl`, Postman, or Python's `requests` library.
2. **Parse the Response:**
   - The response is in JSON format.
   - Extract the `date` (year) and `value` fields.
3. **Repeat for Additional Indicators:**
   - Replace `'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'` with other indicator codes as needed.

**Python Example:**

```python
import requests

indicator_codes = ['DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD']  # List of indicator codes
year = 2020

for code in indicator_codes:
    url = f"https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/{code}?date={year}&format=json&per_page=1000"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    if len(data) > 1:
        records = data[1]
        for record in records:
            value = record['value']
            print(f"Indicator: {code}, Year: {year}, Value: {value}")
    else:
        print(f"No data available for Indicator: {code}, Year: {year}")
```

#### **B. Download Data from the World Bank Data Portal**

**Steps:**
1. **Visit the World Bank Data Portal:**
   - [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)
2. **Search for the Indicators:**
   - Use the indicator codes or names to find the relevant data.
3. **Download the Data:**
   - Choose CSV or Excel format.
4. **Filter the Data Locally:**
   - Open the file in Excel or another tool.
   - Filter for `Country Name` as 'Russian Federation' and the desired `Indicator Code` and `Year`.

---

### **4. Final Recommendations**

- **Ensure Correct SQL Syntax:**
  - Always include conditions within a `WHERE` clause in a complete `SELECT` statement.
- **Monitor Data Scanned:**
  - Use the BigQuery UI to estimate data processed before execution.
- **Consider Quota Limitations:**
  - Optimize queries to scan less data.
  - If necessary, explore upgrading your quota or using paid options.
- **Utilize Alternative Data Sources:**
  - The World Bank API and data downloads provide flexible access without BigQuery limitations.

---

### **Summary**

- **Error Cause:**
  - The initial SQL fragment cannot start with `AND`; it must be part of a complete query.
  - Quota exceeded errors occur when queries scan more data than allowed.
- **Solutions:**
  - Correct the SQL syntax and integrate filters into a full query.
  - Reduce data scanned by adding filters and selecting only necessary columns.
  - Use alternative methods like the World Bank API or data downloads if quota issues persist.

2025-01-20 10:54:49 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:54:49 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering two issues with your SQL query:

1. **Syntax Issue:**

   - The SQL fragment you provided starts with `AND`, which cannot be used at the beginning of a standalone SQL statement.
   - The `AND` operator is used to add conditions to an existing `WHERE` clause within a complete `SELECT` statement.

2. **Quota Exceeded Error:**

   - Even after correcting the syntax, you may still encounter the **"Quota exceeded"** error.
   - This happens because the query scans more data than your BigQuery free tier quota allows.

---

### **Correcting the Syntax**

To fix the syntax error, you need to include the `AND` condition within a complete SQL query. Here's how you can incorporate the filter into your query:

```sql
-- Retrieve records for specific debt indicator codes for Russia
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')  -- Replace with relevant codes
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`SELECT` Clause:** Specifies the columns to retrieve.
- **`FROM` Clause:** Indicates the table to query.
- **`WHERE` Clause:** Begins with `WHERE` and includes all conditions connected by `AND`.
  - **First Condition:** `country_name = 'Russian Federation'`
  - **Second Condition:** `indicator_code` is in the specified list.
- **`LIMIT`:** Limits the number of rows returned to 1,000.

---

### **Addressing the Quota Exceeded Error**

The **"Quota exceeded"** error occurs because your query is scanning more data than allowed under your BigQuery free tier quota. BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data **scanned**, not the amount of data **returned**. Even with filters and a `LIMIT` clause, the amount of data scanned can exceed your quota.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Further Reduce Data Scanned**

**Filter by Year:**

Adding a filter for a specific year can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.

```sql
-- Retrieve records for specific debt indicator codes for Russia in 2020
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')
  AND `year` = 2020  -- Replace 2020 with the desired year
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Select Only Necessary Columns:**

To reduce data scanned, select only the columns you need.

```sql
-- Select only the 'value' and 'year' columns
SELECT `value`, `year`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `indicator_code` IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')
  AND `year` = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **2. Check the Estimated Data Scanned Before Running the Query**

- **In the BigQuery UI:**
  - Paste your query into the editor.
  - Look for the message indicating how much data the query will process.
  - Ensure the estimated data scanned is within your quota limits.

#### **3. Use Alternative Data Sources**

**World Bank API:**

Access the data directly using the World Bank API without BigQuery's quota limitations.

- **Example API Call:**

  Retrieve data for the indicator `DT.DOD.DECT.CD` for Russia in 2020:

  ```
  https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RU/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?date=2020&format=json
  ```

- **Steps:**
  - Use a web browser or tools like `curl`, Postman, or Python scripts to fetch the data.
  - Parse the JSON response to extract the desired information.

**Download Data:**

Download the dataset from the [World Bank Data Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/DT.DOD.DECT.CD?locations=RU) and analyze it locally.

- **Steps:**
  - Visit the link above.
  - Click on the "Download" button.
  - Choose the format (CSV or Excel) and download the file.
  - Open the file in Excel or another spreadsheet application.
  - Filter the data for Russia and the specific indicator codes.

#### **4. Enable Billing to Increase Your Quota**

- **Upgrade Your Google Cloud Project:**
  - Enabling billing removes the free tier limitations and increases your data processing quota.
  - **Caution:** This may incur costs based on the amount of data processed.
  - Ensure you understand the [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) before proceeding.

---

### **Summary**

- **Syntax Correction:**
  - Ensure that your `AND` conditions are included within a `WHERE` clause in a complete SQL query.
  - The corrected query integrates the `indicator_code` filter properly.

- **Quota Issues:**
  - The "Quota exceeded" error occurs because the query scans more data than your quota allows.
  - BigQuery bases charges and quotas on data scanned, not just data returned.

- **Solutions:**
  - **Further Reduce Data Scanned:**
    - Add additional filters like specific years or indicators.
    - Select only the necessary columns.
    - Check the estimated data scanned before executing the query.
  - **Use Alternative Data Sources:**
    - Utilize the World Bank API to access data without BigQuery limitations.
    - Download datasets directly from the World Bank for offline analysis.
  - **Enable Billing:**
    - If acceptable, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your quota.

---

### **Next Steps**

- **Try the Corrected Query:**
  - Use the corrected SQL query with additional filters to reduce data scanned.
  - Check the estimated data scanned in the BigQuery UI.

- **Consider Alternative Methods:**
  - If quota issues persist, use the World Bank API or download data directly.

Task: How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0 (excluding NULL values), you need to count the records in the `international_debt` table where `country_name` is "Russian Federation", `value` equals 0, and `value` is not NULL..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'world_bank_global_population': ['population_by_country'], 'world_bank_health_population': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'health_nutrition_population', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_debt': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_debt', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_education': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_education', 'series_summary'], 'world_bank_wdi': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'footnotes', 'indicators_data', 'series_summary', 'series_time']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
