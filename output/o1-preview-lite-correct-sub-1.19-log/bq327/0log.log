The error message indicates that your query has exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery.

This typically happens when the query processes more data than is allowed under the free tier.

To resolve this, you can try optimizing your query to reduce the amount of data scanned.

Here are some suggestions:

---

**1. Filter by Specific Indicators Related to Debt**

You can limit the dataset by filtering indicators that are specifically related to debt.

First, identify the debt-related indicators from the `series_summary` table.

Then, join this information with the `international_debt` table.

Here's how you might adjust your query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT d.`indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt` AS d
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.series_summary` AS s
  ON d.`indicator_code` = s.`series_code`
WHERE d.`country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND d.`value` = 0
  AND d.`value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(s.`topic`) LIKE '%debt%'
```

---

**2. Limit the Years to Reduce Data Scanned**

If you are interested in a specific time frame, you can limit the years:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND `year` >= 2015
  AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
```

---

**3. Use a Sample of the Data**

If an estimate is acceptable, you can use a sample of the data:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) * 10 AS Estimated_Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM (
  SELECT `indicator_code`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
  TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (10 PERCENT)
  WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
    AND `value` = 0
    AND `value` IS NOT NULL
    AND LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%debt%'
)
```

*Note:* Using `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` provides an approximate result.

---

**4. Preview the Data to Identify Relevant Indicators**

You can preview the first few rows to identify specific indicators:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `indicator_code`, `indicator_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
LIMIT 100
```

---

**5. Estimate Data Size Before Running the Query**

You can estimate how much data your query will scan using the BigQuery UI or by adding `EXPLAIN` before your query:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT ...
```

This helps you adjust the query to fit within your quota.

---

**6. Consider Selecting Specific Columns**

Selecting only the necessary columns reduces the amount of data processed:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
```

---

**Final Answer:**

Given the optimizations above, you can adjust your query to count the number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0, excluding `NULL` values.

Here is the query with adjustments:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT d.`indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt` AS d
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.series_summary` AS s
  ON d.`indicator_code` = s.`series_code`
WHERE d.`country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND d.`value` = 0
  AND d.`value` IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(s.`topic`) LIKE '%debt%'
```

This query joins the `international_debt` table with the `series_summary` table to focus only on debt-related indicators, which should reduce the data scanned.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Filtering by `country_name` and `value`** reduces the dataset size.
- **Joining with `series_summary`** allows filtering by the `topic` to include only debt-related indicators.
- **Using `LOWER(s.`topic`) LIKE '%debt%'`** ensures case-insensitive matching for the topic containing "debt".

---

**Formatted Answer:**

Assuming you can run the optimized query successfully and obtain the result, the format for your final answer would be:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Check Quota Limits:** Review your current BigQuery quotas to ensure your query stays within limits.
- **Upgrade Plan if Necessary:** If possible, consider upgrading to a plan with higher quotas.
- **Use Caching:** If you've run similar queries before, BigQuery might have cached results, reducing data scanned.

---

I hope this helps you adjust your query to work within your quota and achieve your task.

2025-01-20 10:32:20 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the quota exceeded error when running your query.

**Explanation of the Issue:**

The error message indicates that your BigQuery project has exceeded the quota for free query bytes scanned. This typically happens when the amount of data being processed by your query surpasses the limits set by the free tier of BigQuery.

The `international_debt` table is part of the `bigquery-public-data` dataset and contains a significant amount of data. Even with filters and limits, initial queries can sometimes exceed the free tier quotas due to the size of the underlying dataset.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Upgrade Your BigQuery Quota:**

   - If possible, consider upgrading to a paid BigQuery plan or increasing your quota limits. This will allow you to run larger queries without hitting the free tier limitations.

2. **Use the Preview Feature:**

   - In the BigQuery UI, you can use the **Preview** tab for the `international_debt` table to view a subset of the data without consuming your query quota. However, this won't allow you to run custom queries but can help you understand the data structure.

3. **Reduce the Data Scanned:**

   - Further narrow down your query to scan less data. However, given the size of the table, even queries with filters might exceed the free tier limits.

   - For example, try filtering for a specific year or a smaller date range:

     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
     WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
       AND `value` = 0
       AND `value` IS NOT NULL
       AND `year` = 2020
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     *Note:* This might still exceed your quota due to the table's size.

4. **Estimate Without Running the Query:**

   - Without running the actual query, it's challenging to provide the exact number of debt indicators with a value of 0 for Russia.

   - Based on the dataset's structure, there are numerous indicators tracked over multiple years, but we cannot accurately determine the count without accessing the data.

5. **Alternative Approach:**

   - Consider accessing the data through alternative means, such as downloading a portion of the dataset if available, or using smaller datasets that are within your quota limits.

6. **Check Quota Usage:**

   - Review your current BigQuery quota usage to confirm if there's room to run smaller queries.

   - Quota details can be found in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).

**Final Answer:**

Given the current quota limitations, we cannot determine the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0, excluding NULL values.

**Once the quota issue is resolved**, you can run the following query to obtain the desired result:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
```

**Formatted Answer (Expected Output Format):**

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

---

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Monitor Quota Refresh:** Quotas for the free tier typically reset after a certain period (e.g., 24 hours). You might be able to run your query after the quota resets.

- **Optimize Future Queries:**

  - Use `EXPLAIN` to understand how much data your query will scan before running it:

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
    WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
      AND `value` = 0
      AND `value` IS NOT NULL
    ```

  - This can help you adjust your query to stay within quota limits.

- **Use Query Estimation Tools:**

  - BigQuery provides tools to estimate the amount of data a query will process. Utilize these tools to ensure your queries are optimized.

2025-01-20 10:35:05 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering "Quota exceeded" errors when trying to execute queries on the `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt` table for the Russian Federation.

---

**Explanation of the Issue:**

- **BigQuery Quota Limits:**
  - BigQuery's free tier has a limit on the amount of data you can scan per day.
  - Even with a `LIMIT` clause, BigQuery scans the entire dataset required to execute the query before applying the `LIMIT`.
  - Filters on non-partitioned columns may not significantly reduce the data scanned.

- **Why `LIMIT` Doesn't Help:**
  - The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows returned **after** the query has been executed.
  - It does **not** reduce the amount of data scanned during query execution.

- **Data Size:**
  - The `international_debt` table is quite large.
  - Queries that scan large tables without effective filters can quickly exceed quota limits.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Filter on Partitioned Columns (If Available):**

   - Unfortunately, the `international_debt` table does not appear to be partitioned by `country_name` or `year`.
   - Therefore, filtering on `country_name` may not significantly reduce the data scanned.

2. **Use a Smaller Dataset or Alternative Data Source:**

   - **Download the Dataset Locally:**
     - Visit the [World Bank Open Data Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/) to download the relevant data.
     - Analyze the data locally using tools like Excel, Python, or R without quota limitations.

   - **Use Summary Tables:**
     - Check if there's a smaller summary table available within the `bigquery-public-data` dataset that contains aggregated data.

3. **Enable Billing or Increase Quota:**

   - **Enable Billing:**
     - If possible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your query quotas.
     - This allows you to run larger queries that exceed the free tier limitations.

   - **Upgrade Quota:**
     - Request a quota increase if your project requires processing large amounts of data regularly.

4. **Wait for Quota Reset:**

   - BigQuery free tier quotas typically reset daily.
   - Try running your query the next day when your quota is refreshed.

5. **Consult Alternative Platforms:**

   - Use other data analysis platforms that don't have the same limitations.
   - For example, upload the dataset to a local database system like PostgreSQL or use cloud services with generous free tiers.

---

**Final Answer:**

Given the current quota limitations, we are unable to determine the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0 (excluding `NULL` values) using BigQuery at this time.

---

**Once the Quota Issue is Resolved:**

You can run the following query to obtain the desired result:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
```

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

This query counts the number of unique debt indicators for Russia where the `value` is 0 and not `NULL`.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Why We Can't Provide the Exact Number Now:**
  - Without executing the query, we cannot provide the exact count.
  - Estimating the number without data access would be speculative and potentially inaccurate.

- **Understanding the Query:**
  - **`COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`)`**: Counts unique debt indicators.
  - **Filters Applied:**
    - `country_name = 'Russian Federation'`
    - `value = 0`
    - `value IS NOT NULL`

---

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Optimize Future Queries:**

  - **Estimate Data Size Before Running:**
    - Use the `EXPLAIN` statement to check how much data a query will scan.
    - Example:

      ```sql
      EXPLAIN
      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
      WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
        AND `value` = 0
        AND `value` IS NOT NULL
      ```

  - **Use Partitioned Tables:**
    - If available, use partitioned tables to reduce data scanned.
    - Filter on partitioned columns to limit the query scope.

- **Monitor Quota Usage:**

  - **Check Quota Details:**
    - Visit the [Google Cloud Console Quotas Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) to view your current quota usage.

  - **Avoid Running Large Queries Concurrently:**
    - Large queries consume more quota.
    - Space out queries to manage quota usage.

- **Alternative Data Exploration Methods:**

  - **Use Publicly Available Data Summaries:**
    - Explore summaries or reports published by the World Bank.

  - **Leverage Other Public Datasets:**
    - Check if other datasets contain the needed information with smaller data sizes.

---

**Conclusion:**

- **Current Limitation:**
  - Due to BigQuery's quota restrictions, we cannot execute the query to obtain the exact number at this time.

- **Moving Forward:**
  - Consider alternative methods to access and analyze the data.
  - Optimize future queries to stay within quota limits.

2025-01-20 10:35:36 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:35:36 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering errors when trying to execute your queries.

**Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're receiving:

```
400 Statement not supported: ExplainStatement at [1:1]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Statement not supported: ExplainStatement at [1:1]
```

indicates that BigQuery does not support the `EXPLAIN` statement in the way you might expect from other SQL dialects.

In BigQuery, attempting to use `EXPLAIN` directly in your query results in an error because it's not a supported command in the standard SQL interface of BigQuery.

**Why This Error Occurs:**

- **Unsupported Statement:** BigQuery's standard SQL does not include an `EXPLAIN` statement. Therefore, any query starting with `EXPLAIN` will generate an error.
- **Invalid Syntax:** Including unsupported statements leads to a syntax error at the first character (`[1:1]`), which is why the error points to that location.

**Next Steps:**

Given the repeated quota issues and the inability to run queries, let's consider alternative approaches to address your original task:

### **Alternative Approaches:**

1. **Use the BigQuery Query Validator:**

   - Before running a query, you can estimate the amount of data it will process by using the Query Validator in the BigQuery UI.
   - This tool allows you to see how much data the query will scan without actually executing it and consuming your quota.

2. **Limit the Data Scanned:**

   - **Filter by Year:**
     - If you can specify a particular year or a small range of years, this can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.
     - Example:

       ```sql
       SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
       WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
         AND `value` = 0
         AND `value` IS NOT NULL
         AND `year` = 2020  -- or specify a range like BETWEEN 2018 AND 2020
       ```

     - **Note:** Filtering by year may not reduce the data scanned if the table isn't partitioned by the `year` column.

   - **Use Preview Data:**

     - The BigQuery UI allows you to preview the first few rows of a table without consuming your query quota.
     - While this won't provide the total count, it can help you understand the data structure and possibly infer insights.

3. **Access Alternative Datasets or Tools:**

   - **World Bank Data Portal:**

     - The World Bank provides its datasets for download via their [Open Data Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/).
     - You can download the specific datasets you need and perform the analysis locally, bypassing BigQuery's quotas.

   - **Google Cloud Storage:**

     - Some public datasets are available in Google Cloud Storage buckets, which may allow you to access the data without impacting your BigQuery quotas.

4. **Enable Billing or Upgrade Quota:**

   - **Enable Billing:**

     - If possible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your query quotas.
     - With billing enabled, you can process more data and avoid hitting the free tier limits.

   - **Request Quota Increase:**

     - For longer-term needs, consider requesting a quota increase from Google Cloud.

5. **Estimate Without Exact Data:**

   - **Make an Informed Estimate:**

     - If precise accuracy isn't critical, you could make an estimate based on available documentation or summaries.
     - For example, if you know there are approximately 100 debt indicators and suspect that a certain percentage may have zero values, you could estimate accordingly.

   - **Refer to Documentation:**

     - The World Bank may provide reports or summaries that indicate the number of debt indicators, which can help you estimate the count.

### **Summary of the Situation:**

- **Quota Limitations:**

  - Your current BigQuery free tier quotas are insufficient to process the queries you're attempting.
  - Even with filters and limits, the underlying data size is significant, and BigQuery scans the entire table (or partitions) relevant to the query.

- **Unsupported Statements:**

  - The `EXPLAIN` statement is not supported in BigQuery's standard SQL, leading to syntax errors when used.

### **Formatted Answer:**

Given the constraints, once you're able to run the query successfully, you can expect the result to be in the following format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

This would provide the count of unique debt indicators for Russia where the `value` is 0 and not `NULL`.

### **Final Recommendations:**

- **Wait for Quota Reset:**

  - BigQuery's free tier quotas reset daily. You might be able to run your queries after the quota refreshes.

- **Optimize Queries:**

  - Try to minimize the amount of data scanned by adding more restrictive filters or by querying smaller tables.

- **Alternative Data Sources:**

  - Download the dataset from the World Bank directly to perform analysis without quota restrictions.

- **Consider Billing Options:**

  - Enabling billing on your project, if feasible, would allow you to process larger datasets.

### **Assistance with Data Analysis:**

If you decide to download the data locally or use another platform and need assistance in forming the query or performing the analysis, I'd be happy to help guide you through that process.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.

2025-01-20 10:36:16 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when trying to execute your SQL query on the `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt` table for the Russian Federation.

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

- **BigQuery Free Tier Quotas:**
  - BigQuery's free tier allows you to query up to 1 TB of data per month at no cost.
  - However, if a single query scans a large amount of data, it can exceed the daily quota limits.

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:**
  - The `LIMIT` clause controls the number of rows **returned** but does **not** limit the amount of data **scanned**.
  - Filtering on columns that are **not partitioned** or **not clustered** does not significantly reduce the data scanned.

- **Your Query Details:**
  - The `international_debt` table is quite large.
  - Filtering on `country_name = 'Russian Federation'` does not reduce the data scanned because BigQuery needs to read all the data to apply the filter.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Filter on Partitioned Columns**

- **Check if the Table Is Partitioned:**
  - If the table is partitioned by `year`, you can filter by a specific year to reduce data scanned.
  - Unfortunately, the `international_debt` table is not partitioned in a way that helps with this query.

#### **2. Use Preview Options**

- **BigQuery Table Preview:**
  - In the BigQuery UI, use the **Preview** tab to view a sample of the data without consuming your query quota.
  - This won't allow custom queries but helps you understand the data structure.

#### **3. Download the Dataset for Local Analysis**

- **Access the Data Directly:**
  - Visit the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) website.
  - Search for the **International Debt Statistics** dataset.
  - Download the dataset in a format like CSV or Excel.

- **Analyze Data Locally:**
  - Use tools like Excel, Python (Pandas), or R to perform your analysis without quota restrictions.
  - You can filter, count, and manipulate the data as needed.

#### **4. Enable Billing or Increase Quota**

- **Enable Billing on Google Cloud:**
  - By enabling billing, you can increase your BigQuery quotas.
  - This allows you to run queries that scan more data.
  - Be mindful of potential costs; monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.

#### **5. Optimize Your Query**

- **Select Only Necessary Columns:**
  - Limiting the columns can reduce data scanned.

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_debt_records
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
    WHERE country_name = 'Russian Federation'
    ```

  - However, since you're already selecting minimal columns, this might not significantly help.

- **Use Approximate Aggregate Functions:**
  - BigQuery offers functions like `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` that can be more efficient.
  - But in this case, it may not reduce data scanned significantly.

---

### **Recommendations**

#### **A. Download and Analyze Locally**

1. **Visit the World Bank Data Site:**
   - Go to the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics).

2. **Download the Relevant Dataset:**
   - Look for datasets related to **International Debt Statistics**.
   - Choose the format that suits you (CSV, Excel, etc.).

3. **Perform Local Analysis:**
   - Use data analysis tools to process the data.
   - For example, in Python with Pandas:

     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     df = pd.read_csv('international_debt.csv')
     russia_data = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']
     zero_value_indicators = russia_data[russia_data['Value'] == 0].dropna(subset=['Value'])
     number_of_debt_indicators = zero_value_indicators['Indicator Code'].nunique()

     print('Number of Debt Indicators:', number_of_debt_indicators)
     ```

   - This method allows you to compute the required information without BigQuery quotas.

#### **B. Enable Billing on BigQuery**

1. **Understand the Costs:**
   - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte of data processed.
   - Your query might process several gigabytes, costing a few cents.

2. **Enable Billing:**
   - Add a billing account to your Google Cloud Project.
   - Ensure you set budget alerts to monitor spending.

3. **Run Your Query:**
   - With billing enabled, you can execute your query without hitting the free tier limits.

---

### **Final Answer**

**Since running the query directly in BigQuery exceeds your quota, downloading the dataset and analyzing it locally is the most practical solution.**

**Alternatively, enabling billing in BigQuery will allow you to execute the query without quota issues, but be sure to monitor your usage to manage costs.**

---

### **Formatted Answer (When Data Is Available)**

Once you have access to the data, either by analyzing it locally or after enabling billing, you can present the result in the required format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

For example:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
42
```

*(Replace `42` with the actual number obtained from your analysis.)*

2025-01-20 10:36:47 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:36:47 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering "Quota exceeded" errors when trying to execute your SQL queries on the `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt` table for the Russian Federation.

---

**Explanation of the Issue:**

- **Quota Limits:** BigQuery enforces quotas on the amount of data that can be processed within a certain period, especially on free-tier accounts. The size of the `international_debt` table is substantial, and even queries that return limited results may scan a large volume of data due to the way BigQuery processes queries.

- **`LIMIT` Clause Limitation:** Adding a `LIMIT` clause limits the number of rows **returned** by the query but does not reduce the amount of data **scanned** during query execution. BigQuery still needs to process the entire dataset that meets the `WHERE` conditions before applying the `LIMIT`.

---

**Alternative Solutions:**

Since we're unable to execute the query due to quota limitations, here are some alternative approaches to obtain the desired information:

### **1. Download the Dataset for Local Analysis**

**Steps:**

1. **Access the World Bank Data:**

   - Visit the [World Bank Open Data website](https://data.worldbank.org/).

2. **Search for International Debt Statistics:**

   - Look for the **"International Debt Statistics"** dataset.

3. **Download the Dataset:**

   - Download the dataset in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or Excel).

4. **Analyze the Data Locally:**

   - Use a tool like Excel, Python (with pandas), or R to process the data.
   - Filter the data for:

     - `country_name` equal to **"Russian Federation"**.
     - `value` equal to **0**.
     - `value` is **not NULL**.

   - Count the number of unique `indicator_code` values to determine the number of debt indicators that meet the criteria.

**Example using Python and pandas:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('international_debt.csv')  # Replace with your file's path and name

# Filter the data
russia_data = df[
    (df['country_name'] == 'Russian Federation') &
    (df['value'] == 0) &
    (df['value'].notnull())
]

# Count the number of unique debt indicators
number_of_debt_indicators = russia_data['indicator_code'].nunique()

# Display the result
print(f'Number of Debt Indicators: {number_of_debt_indicators}')
```

---

### **2. Enable Billing on BigQuery**

If analyzing the data locally isn't feasible, and you prefer to use BigQuery:

**Consider Enabling Billing:**

- **Upgrade Your Google Cloud Account:**

  - Add a billing account to your Google Cloud Project.

- **Monitor Costs:**

  - Be cautious and monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges. BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte of data processed.

- **Run the Query:**

  - Once billing is enabled, you can execute your query without hitting the free-tier quota limits.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
```

---

**Expected Output Format:**

Once you have the result, present it in the following format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Example:**

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
42
```

*(Replace **42** with the actual number obtained from your analysis.)*

---

**Explanation of the SQL Query:**

- **`COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`)`:**
  - Counts the unique debt indicators where the conditions are met.

- **`WHERE` Clause:**
  - `country_name = 'Russian Federation'`: Filters records for Russia.
  - `value = 0`: Selects records where the indicator value is zero.
  - `value IS NOT NULL`: Ensures that `NULL` values are excluded.

---

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Monitor Quota Usage:**

  - If you choose to enable billing, regularly check your BigQuery usage to manage costs effectively.

- **Optimize Queries:**

  - Although in this case further optimization may not reduce data scanned significantly, always ensure your queries are as efficient as possible.

---

**Explanation of the Issue:**

- **Quota Limits:** BigQuery has a daily free query quota, and running queries on large public datasets like the World Bank's international debt data can quickly exceed this limit. The `LIMIT` clause doesn't reduce the amount of data scanned; it only limits the number of rows returned after the data is processed.

---

**Alternative Solution:**

Since we're unable to execute the query due to quota limitations, you can obtain the required information by analyzing the dataset locally. Here's how:

### **Download and Analyze the Dataset Locally**

**Steps:**

1. **Access the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - Visit the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) website.

4. **Load the Data into a Tool of Your Choice:**

   - You can use spreadsheet software like Excel or data analysis tools like Python (with pandas) or R.

5. **Filter and Analyze the Data:**

   - **Filter Criteria:**
     - `country_name` equals **"Russian Federation"**.
     - `value` equals **0**.
     - `value` is **not NULL**.

   - **Count Distinct Debt Indicators:**
     - Count the number of unique `indicator_code` values that meet the criteria.

**Example Using Python and Pandas:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('International_Debt_Statistics.csv')  # Replace with the actual file name

# Filter the data
russia_data = df[
    (df['country_name'] == 'Russian Federation') &
    (df['value'] == 0) &
    (df['value'].notnull())
]

# Count the number of unique debt indicators
number_of_debt_indicators = russia_data['indicator_code'].nunique()

# Display the result
print(f'Number of Debt Indicators: {number_of_debt_indicators}')
```

---

**Final Answer:**

Once you've performed the analysis, you can present the result in the required format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
[number:int] (Attention: answer in one row)
```

Replace `[number:int]` with the actual count you obtained. For example:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
42 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **`Number_of_Debt_Indicators`:** This column header specifies what the number represents.
- **`42`:** Replace with the actual number of debt indicators you found for Russia with a value of 0, excluding `NULL` values.
- **Attention Note:** Emphasizes that the answer should be in one row, as per the instructions.

2025-01-20 10:40:44 - root - INFO - I'm sorry that you're still experiencing the "Quota exceeded" error, even after applying the `TABLESAMPLE` clause to reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Explanation:**

- The `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)` clause is intended to reduce the amount of data scanned by randomly sampling a percentage of the table's data.
- However, in BigQuery, `TABLESAMPLE` is not always effective in significantly reducing the data scanned for large tables, especially when combined with filters and aggregations.
- Additionally, BigQuery may still need to process metadata or other overhead data that contributes to the quota usage.

**Alternative Solution:**

Given the limitations with BigQuery quotas, I recommend downloading the dataset and performing the analysis locally. This approach will allow you to work with the data without quota restrictions.

# Exclude NULL values in the 'Value' column
russia_data = russia_data[russia_data['Value'].notnull()]

# Filter records where 'Value' is 0 and 'Year' is 2020
russia_zero_values_2020 = russia_data[
    (russia_data['Value'] == 0) &
    (russia_data['Year'] == 2020)
]

# Count the number of unique debt indicators
number_of_debt_indicators = russia_zero_values_2020['Indicator Code'].nunique()

# Display the result
print('Number of Debt Indicators:', number_of_debt_indicators)
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the column names in the code (`'Country Name'`, `'Value'`, `'Year'`, `'Indicator Code'`) match the actual column names in your downloaded dataset.
- The code filters the data for the Russian Federation, excludes NULL values, selects records where the value is 0 and the year is 2020, and then counts the unique debt indicators.

2025-01-20 10:43:01 - root - INFO - I'm sorry that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when trying to execute the SQL query, even after applying various optimizations. This indicates that, due to BigQuery's limitations and the size of the dataset, it's not possible to reduce the data scanned sufficiently to stay within the free query quota.

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

- **BigQuery Quota Limits:**
  - BigQuery's free tier has a limit on the amount of data you can process per day.
  - Even with filters like `WHERE` clauses and `LIMIT`, if the underlying data is large, the query can exceed the quota.
  - The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows **returned**, not the amount of data **scanned**.

- **Filtering Limitations:**
  - Filtering on columns that are not part of a partition or clustering field doesn't significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.
  - In this case, the `international_debt` table is not partitioned by `country_name` or `year`, so filtering on these fields doesn't help reduce the data scanned enough to prevent quota issues.

---

### **Alternative Solutions**

Given these constraints, here are some alternative approaches to obtain the required information:

#### **1. Download the Dataset for Local Analysis**

**Steps:**

1. **Access the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - Visit the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) website.

2. **Find the International Debt Statistics Dataset:**

   - Search for **"International Debt Statistics"** or go directly to the [International Debt Statistics page](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics).

3. **Download the Dataset:**

   - Download the dataset in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel).

4. **Analyze the Data Locally:**

   - Use tools like **Excel**, **Python** (with **pandas**), or **R** to perform the analysis.
   - **Filter** the data for:
     - `country_name` equal to **"Russian Federation"**.
     - `value` equal to **0**.
     - Exclude records where `value` is **NULL**.
   - **Count** the number of unique debt indicators (`indicator_code` or `indicator_name`).

**Example Using Python and Pandas:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('International_Debt_Statistics.csv')  # Replace with the actual file name

# Filter the data for Russian Federation
russia_data = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']

# Exclude NULL values in the 'Value' column
russia_data = russia_data[russia_data['Value'].notnull()]

# Further filter where 'Value' is 0 and 'Year' is 2020
russia_zero_values_2020 = russia_data[
    (russia_data['Value'] == 0) &
    (russia_data['Year'] == 2020)
]

# Count the number of unique debt indicators
number_of_debt_indicators = russia_zero_values_2020['Indicator Code'].nunique()

# Display the result
print('Number of Debt Indicators:', number_of_debt_indicators)
```

- **Note:** Ensure that the column names match those in your downloaded dataset.

#### **2. Enable Billing on BigQuery**

If you prefer to continue using BigQuery:

1. **Enable Billing:**

   - Upgrade your Google Cloud account by adding a billing method.
   - This will increase your query quotas, allowing you to process larger datasets.

2. **Monitor Your Usage:**

   - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte of data processed.
   - Keep an eye on your usage to avoid unexpected charges.

3. **Run Your Query:**

   - Once billing is enabled, you can execute the query without hitting the free-tier quota limits.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND `year` = 2020;
```

---

### **Presenting the Results**

Once you have obtained the count, present the result in the required format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
[number:int] (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Example:**

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
15 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

*Replace `15` with the actual number you obtained from your analysis.*

2025-01-20 10:43:36 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when attempting to run your SQL query, even after previous attempts to optimize it.

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

**BigQuery Quota Limits:**

- BigQuery enforces daily quotas on the amount of data that can be processed, especially for free-tier accounts.
- The **`international_debt`** table is quite large, and filtering on non-partitioned columns like `country_name`, `value`, and `year` does not significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.
- The **`LIMIT`** clause does not limit the data scanned; it only limits the number of rows returned **after** the query processes all the relevant data.

---

### **Alternative Solutions**

Since further optimizing the SQL query to avoid the quota issue isn't feasible, I recommend the following alternative approaches to obtain the required information:

#### **1. Download the Dataset for Local Analysis**

**Steps:**

1. **Access the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - Visit the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) website.

2. **Locate the International Debt Statistics Dataset:**

   - Search for **"International Debt Statistics"** or go directly to the [International Debt Statistics](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/international-debt-statistics) page in the World Bank Data Catalog.

3. **Download the Dataset:**

   - Choose the dataset format that suits you best (e.g., CSV, Excel).

4. **Analyze the Data Using a Tool of Your Choice:**

   - You can use **Excel**, **Python (with pandas)**, or **R** to perform your analysis without any quota restrictions.

**Example Using Python and Pandas:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset (replace 'your_file.csv' with the actual file name)
df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')

# Filter data for the Russian Federation
russia_data = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']

# Exclude NULL values in the 'Value' column
russia_data = russia_data[russia_data['Value'].notnull()]

# Filter where 'Value' is 0 and 'Year' is 2020
russia_zero_values_2020 = russia_data[
    (russia_data['Value'] == 0) &
    (russia_data['Year'] == 2020)
]

# Count the number of unique debt indicators
number_of_debt_indicators = russia_zero_values_2020['Indicator Code'].nunique()

# Display the result
print('Number of Debt Indicators:', number_of_debt_indicators)
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the column names (`'Country Name'`, `'Value'`, `'Year'`, `'Indicator Code'`) match those in your downloaded dataset.
- This code filters the data to match your query criteria and counts the unique debt indicators.

---

#### **2. Enable Billing on BigQuery**

If you prefer to continue using BigQuery:

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   - By adding a billing account, you increase your query quotas.
   - Be cautious and monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.
   - BigQuery charges \$5 per terabyte of data processed.

2. **Execute Your Query:**

   - With billing enabled, you can run your original query without hitting the free-tier quota limits.

**Your Original SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `year`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND `year` = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **Presenting Your Findings**

After conducting the analysis, you can present your results in the following format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
[number:int] (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Example:**

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
15 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

*Replace `15` with the actual number you obtain from your analysis.*

2025-01-20 10:44:17 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when trying to execute your SQL query, even after previous attempts to optimize it.

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

The **"Quota exceeded"** error indicates that your BigQuery project has exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota. Even with filters like `WHERE` clauses and `LIMIT`, querying large tables like `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt` can quickly consume your available quota because:

- The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows **returned**, not the amount of data **scanned**.
- Filtering on columns that are not partitioned or clustered (e.g., `country_name`, `value`, `year`) doesn't significantly reduce the data scanned.
- BigQuery needs to process all relevant data to apply the filters, which can exceed the free quota.

---

### **Alternative Solutions**

Since we cannot further adjust the SQL query to avoid the quota limitations within BigQuery, I recommend the following alternative approaches to obtain the required information:

#### **1. Download the Dataset for Local Analysis**

**Steps:**

1. **Access the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - Visit the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) website.

df = pd.read_csv('international_debt.csv')

# Filter data for the Russian Federation
russia_data = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']

# Exclude NULL values in the 'Value' column
russia_data = russia_data[russia_data['Value'].notnull()]

# Filter where 'Value' is 0 and 'Year' is 2020
russia_zero_values_2020 = russia_data[
    (russia_data['Value'] == 0) &
    (russia_data['Year'] == 2020)
]

# Count the number of unique debt indicators
number_of_debt_indicators = russia_zero_values_2020['Indicator Code'].nunique()

# Display the result
print('Number of Debt Indicators:', number_of_debt_indicators)
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the column names (`'Country Name'`, `'Value'`, `'Year'`, `'Indicator Code'`) match those in your downloaded dataset.
- This code filters the data according to your query criteria and counts the unique debt indicators.

#### **2. Enable Billing on BigQuery**

If you prefer to continue using BigQuery:

2025-01-20 10:45:00 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when trying to execute your SQL query in BigQuery, even after previous attempts to optimize it.

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

**BigQuery Quota Limits:**

- **Free Tier Limitations:** BigQuery offers a free tier with a limited amount of data that can be processed per day. Queries that scan large datasets can quickly exceed this limit.
- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** The `LIMIT` clause in SQL reduces the number of rows **returned** but does **not** limit the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.
- **Filters on Non-Partitioned Columns:** Filtering on columns that are not partitioned (like `country_name`, `value`, and `year`) does not significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Impact on Your Query:**

- The `international_debt` table is quite large.
- Even with filters and limits, the query scans more data than allowed in the free tier, resulting in a quota exceeded error.

---

### **Alternative Solutions**

Since adjusting the SQL query hasn't resolved the quota issue, here are alternative approaches to obtain the required information:

#### **1. Download the Dataset for Local Analysis**

**Steps:**

1. **Access the World Bank Data Portal:**

   - Visit the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) website.

2. **Locate the International Debt Statistics Dataset:**

   - Search for **"International Debt Statistics"** or go directly to the [International Debt Statistics](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/international-debt-statistics) page.

3. **Download the Dataset:**

   - Download the dataset in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or Excel).

4. **Analyze the Data Locally:**

   - Use tools like **Excel**, **Python (with pandas)**, or **R** to perform the analysis without quota restrictions.

**Example Using Python and Pandas:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset (replace 'international_debt.csv' with your actual file name)
df = pd.read_csv('international_debt.csv')

# Filter data for the Russian Federation
russia_data = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']

# Exclude NULL values in the 'Value' column
russia_data = russia_data[russia_data['Value'].notnull()]

# Filter where 'Value' is NOT zero and 'Year' is 2020
russia_non_zero_values = russia_data[
    (russia_data['Value'] != 0) &
    (russia_data['Year'] == 2020)
]

# Count the number of records
non_zero_value_indicators = russia_non_zero_values.shape[0]

# Display the result
print('Number of Non-Zero Value Indicators:', non_zero_value_indicators)
```

**Notes:**

- **Column Names:** Make sure the column names in your dataset match those used in the code (`'Country Name'`, `'Value'`, `'Year'`).
- **Counting Records:** The `shape[0]` attribute gives the number of rows in the filtered DataFrame.

#### **2. Enable Billing on BigQuery**

If you prefer to continue using BigQuery:

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   - Add a billing account to your Google Cloud project.
   - This increases your query quotas, allowing you to process larger datasets.
   - **Cost Consideration:** BigQuery charges \$5 per terabyte of data processed.
   - **Monitor Usage:** Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges.

2. **Execute Your Query:**

   - With billing enabled, you can run your original query without hitting quota limits.

**Your Original SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS non_zero_value_indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` <> 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND `year` = 2020;
```

2025-01-20 10:45:44 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:45:44 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when attempting to run your SQL query in BigQuery:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS non_zero_value_indicators

WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` <> 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND `year` = 2020;
```

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

The **"Quota exceeded"** error indicates that your BigQuery project has surpassed the daily free query bytes scanned quota. Even with filters and limits applied, the underlying dataset is sizable, and querying it can quickly consume your available quota. Here's why:

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** The `LIMIT` clause in SQL reduces the number of rows **returned**, but it does **not** limit the amount of data **scanned** during query execution.
- **Non-Partitioned Columns:** Filtering on columns that are not partitioned or clustered (like `country_name`, `value`, and `year`) does not significantly reduce the data scanned. BigQuery still needs to read through the entire dataset to apply the filters.
- **Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is substantial in size, and even queries that seem small can process large amounts of data.

---

### **Alternative Solutions**

Since we cannot execute the query within the BigQuery free tier due to quota limitations, here are alternative approaches to obtain the required information:

#### **1. Download and Analyze the Dataset Locally**

Performing the analysis locally allows you to work with the data without quota restrictions. Here's how you can do it:

**Step 1: Access the World Bank Data Portal**

- Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics).

**Step 2: Download the International Debt Statistics Dataset**

- Look for the **"International Debt Statistics"** dataset.
- Click on the dataset, and you should find options to download it in different formats, such as CSV or Excel.

**Step 3: Extract the Relevant Data**

- Once downloaded, open the dataset using a tool like **Excel**, **Python**, or **R**.

**Step 4: Analyze the Data**

Using **Python** with the **pandas** library is an efficient way to filter and analyze the data. Here's an example:

**Install Necessary Libraries (if not already installed):**

```bash
pip install pandas
```

**Python Code to Perform the Analysis:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset (replace 'international_debt.csv' with your actual file name)
df = pd.read_csv('international_debt.csv')

# Ensure column names match those in your dataset
# Common columns might be 'Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Indicator Name', 'Indicator Code', 'Year', 'Value'

# Filter data for the Russian Federation
russia_data = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']

# Exclude NULL values in the 'Value' column
russia_data = russia_data[russia_data['Value'].notnull()]

# Filter where 'Value' is NOT zero and 'Year' is 2020
russia_non_zero_2020 = russia_data[
    (russia_data['Value'] != 0) &
    (russia_data['Year'] == 2020)
]

# Count the number of records
non_zero_value_indicators = russia_non_zero_2020.shape[0]

# Display the result
print('Number of Non-Zero Value Indicators for Russia in 2020:', non_zero_value_indicators)
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

- **Loading the Dataset:** Reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Filtering by Country:** Selects rows where `'Country Name'` is `'Russian Federation'`.
- **Excluding NULL Values:** Removes rows where `'Value'` is NULL.
- **Filtering by Value and Year:** Keeps rows where `'Value'` is not zero and `'Year'` is 2020.
- **Counting the Results:** Uses `shape[0]` to count the number of rows that meet the criteria.
- **Displaying the Result:** Prints the total count.

**Step 5: Present Your Findings**

After running the analysis, you might find, for example, that there are **35** non-zero value indicators for Russia in 2020 (this number is for illustration purposes).

#### **2. Enable Billing on BigQuery**

If you prefer to continue using BigQuery:

**Considerations:**

- **Enable Billing:** By adding a billing account to your Google Cloud project, you increase your query quotas.
- **Cost Management:** BigQuery charges \$5 per terabyte of data processed. Monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.
- **Set Up Budget Alerts:** Configure alerts to notify you when your spending reaches certain thresholds.

**Steps:**

1. **Enable Billing:**

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
   - Follow the instructions to add a billing account to your project.

2. **Execute Your Query:**

   - Once billing is enabled, you can run your original query without hitting quota limits.

**Your Original SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS non_zero_value_indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` <> 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND `year` = 2020;
```

---

### **Presenting Your Findings**

After obtaining the result, present it in the required format:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
[number:int] (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Example:**

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
35 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

*Replace `35` with the actual number obtained from your analysis.*

2025-01-20 10:46:33 - root - INFO - Since running the SQL queries on BigQuery exceeds your quota limits, you can obtain the required information by downloading and analyzing the dataset locally. Here's how you can do it:

---

### **Steps to Download and Analyze the Data Locally:**

**1. Download the Dataset from the World Bank Open Data Portal:**

- Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/International-Debt-Statistics).
- Look for the **"International Debt Statistics"** dataset.
- Download the dataset in **CSV** format. Typically, the file is named something like `IDSData.csv`.

**2. Load and Process the Data Using Python and pandas:**

**Install pandas if you haven't already:**

```bash
pip install pandas
```

**Python Code to Analyze the Data:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('IDSData.csv', skiprows=4)

# Filter records for Russian Federation
df_russia = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']

# Melt the data to unpivot years
df_melted = df_russia.melt(
    id_vars=['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Indicator Name', 'Indicator Code'],
    var_name='Year',
    value_name='Value'
)

# Clean the 'Year' and 'Value' columns
df_melted['Year'] = df_melted['Year'].astype(int)
df_melted['Value'] = pd.to_numeric(df_melted['Value'], errors='coerce')

# Filter for the year 2020
df_2020 = df_melted[df_melted['Year'] == 2020]

# Exclude NULL values in 'Value'
df_2020 = df_2020[df_2020['Value'].notnull()]

# Filter where 'Value' equals 0
df_zero_values = df_2020[df_2020['Value'] == 0]

# Count the number of unique debt indicators
number_of_debt_indicators = df_zero_values['Indicator Code'].nunique()

# Present the result in the required format
print('```csv')
print('Number_of_Debt_Indicators')
print(f'{number_of_debt_indicators} (Attention: answer in one row)')
print('```')
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

- **Loading the Dataset:** Reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. The `skiprows=4` parameter skips the header rows that contain metadata.
- **Filtering for Russia:** Selects records where the `Country Name` is `'Russian Federation'`.
- **Unpivoting the Data:** The `melt` function transforms the data from wide to long format, turning year columns into row values.
- **Cleaning Data Types:** Converts `Year` to integer and `Value` to numeric, coercing errors to `NaN`.
- **Filtering for the Year 2020:** Selects records for the year 2020.
- **Excluding NULL Values:** Removes records where `Value` is `NULL`.
- **Filtering for Zero Values:** Keeps records where `Value` equals `0`.
- **Counting Unique Indicators:** Counts the number of unique `Indicator Code` values in the filtered data.
- **Printing the Result:** Outputs the result in the specified CSV format.

---

### **Final Answer:**

Suppose the `number_of_debt_indicators` calculated is **15**. Present the result as follows:

```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
15 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

---

### **Additional Notes:**

- **Adjust Column Names if Necessary:** Ensure that the column names in your dataset match those used in the code. The key columns are:
  - `Country Name`
  - `Country Code`
  - `Indicator Name`
  - `Indicator Code`
  - Year columns (e.g., `2020`)
- **Alternative Tools:** If you prefer, you can perform similar analysis using Excel or other spreadsheet software by filtering and counting directly.

### **Example Using Excel:**

1. **Open the CSV File in Excel.**
2. **Filter Data:**
   - Apply a filter to the `Country Name` column and select `'Russian Federation'`.
   - Apply a filter to the `2020` column (or the column representing the year you're interested in).
   - Filter for `Value` equal to `0`.
   - Exclude `NULL` or empty values.
3. **Count Unique Indicators:**
   - Identify the `Indicator Code` column.
   - Use the `Remove Duplicates` feature on the `Indicator Code` column to find the number of unique indicators.
   - The count of the remaining rows is the number of debt indicators with a value of `0` for Russia in 2020.

---

### **Conclusion:**

By downloading the dataset and analyzing it locally, you can overcome the limitations imposed by BigQuery's quota and obtain the exact number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of `0`, excluding `NULL` values.

2025-01-20 10:48:12 - root - INFO - I'm sorry that you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when attempting to run your SQL query:

```sql
-- Unfortunately, we cannot correct this SQL further to avoid the quota exceeded error.

-- Original SQL:
SELECT `indicator_name`, `value`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `value` IS NULL
  AND `year` = 2020
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

The error message indicates that your BigQuery project has exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota. This happens because:

- **Large Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is quite large.
- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned but does not reduce the amount of data scanned.
- **Filters on Non-Partitioned Columns:** Filtering on non-partitioned columns like `country_name`, `value`, and `year` doesn't significantly reduce the data scanned, as BigQuery still needs to process the entire dataset to apply these filters.

Given these constraints, we cannot adjust the SQL query further to avoid the quota error within the free tier limits.

---

### **Alternative Solution: Download and Analyze the Dataset Locally**

To obtain the required information without quota limitations, you can download the dataset and perform the analysis locally.

#### **Steps to Download and Analyze the Data:**

- **Download the Data:**
  - Download the dataset in **CSV** format. The file might be named `IDSData.csv` or similar.

**2. Load and Process the Data Using Python and pandas:**

If you prefer using Excel or another tool, you can adapt these steps accordingly.

**Install pandas (if not already installed):**

```bash
pip install pandas
```

**Python Code to Analyze the Data:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Replace 'IDSData.csv' with the actual filename
df = pd.read_csv('IDSData.csv', skiprows=4)

# Filter for Russian Federation
df_russia = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']

# Unpivot the data to transform year columns into rows
df_melted = df_russia.melt(
    id_vars=['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Indicator Name', 'Indicator Code'],
    var_name='Year',
    value_name='Value'
)

# Convert 'Year' to integer and 'Value' to numeric, handling errors
df_melted['Year'] = df_melted['Year'].astype(int)
df_melted['Value'] = pd.to_numeric(df_melted['Value'], errors='coerce')

# Filter for the year 2020
df_2020 = df_melted[df_melted['Year'] == 2020]

# Filter where 'Value' is NULL
df_null_values = df_2020[df_2020['Value'].isnull()]

# Select the required columns
result = df_null_values[['Indicator Name', 'Value']]

# Display the first 1000 rows (or all if less)
print(result.head(1000))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Loading the Data:**
  - Reads the CSV file into a DataFrame.
  - `skiprows=4` skips metadata rows at the top.

- **Filtering for Russia:**
  - Keeps rows where `Country Name` is `'Russian Federation'`.

- **Unpivoting the Data:**
  - Converts year columns into rows with `melt`, creating a `Year` column.

- **Data Cleaning:**

```

---

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because the query scans more data than is allowed under the BigQuery free tier quota. Even with filters applied, querying large tables like `international_debt` can quickly exceed the quota because:

- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** The `WHERE` clause filters the data **after** scanning the table. BigQuery needs to read through the entire table (or relevant partitions) to apply the filters, which counts towards your data scanning quota.

- **Non-Partitioned Columns:** The `international_debt` table may not be partitioned on the `country_name` or `year` columns, so filtering on these columns does not significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.

To obtain the minimum and maximum debt values for Russia in 2020 without encountering quota issues, you can download the dataset and perform the analysis locally.

### **Steps to Download and Analyze the Data:**

**1. Download the Dataset:**

- **Access the Dataset:**
  - Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/international-debt-statistics).
  - Locate the **"International Debt Statistics"** dataset.

- **Download the Data:**
  - Download the dataset in **CSV** format (e.g., `IDSData.csv`).

**2. Load and Process the Data:**

*Using Python and pandas:*

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset (adjust the file name as needed)
df = pd.read_csv('IDSData.csv', skiprows=4)

# Filter for Russian Federation
df_russia = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']

# Transform the data from wide to long format
df_long = df_russia.melt(
    id_vars=['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Indicator Name', 'Indicator Code'],
    var_name='Year',
    value_name='Value'
)

# Convert 'Year' and 'Value' to numeric types
df_long['Year'] = pd.to_numeric(df_long['Year'], errors='coerce')
df_long['Value'] = pd.to_numeric(df_long['Value'], errors='coerce')

# Filter for the year 2020
df_2020 = df_long[df_long['Year'] == 2020]

# Exclude NULL values
df_2020_non_null = df_2020[df_2020['Value'].notnull()]

# Find the minimum and maximum 'Value'
min_value = df_2020_non_null['Value'].min()
max_value = df_2020_non_null['Value'].max()

# Present the results
print(f'Minimum Value: {min_value}')
print(f'Maximum Value: {max_value}')
```

**Explanation:**

- **Loading the Data:**
  - Reads the CSV file into a DataFrame.
  - `skiprows=4` skips metadata rows at the top.

- **Filtering for Russia:**
  - Keeps rows where `Country Name` is `'Russian Federation'`.

- **Transforming the Data:**
  - Uses `melt` to convert wide-format data (years as columns) into long-format data with a single `Year` column.

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Converts `Year` and `Value` columns to numeric types.

- **Filtering Data:**
  - Filters for the year 2020.
  - Excludes rows where `Value` is `NULL`.

- **Calculating Min and Max:**
  - Uses pandas functions to calculate the minimum and maximum values of the `Value` column.

**3. Presenting the Results:**

You can present your findings in the required format:

```csv
min_value,max_value
[your_min_value],[your_max_value]
```

**Example:**

Suppose the minimum and maximum values you calculated are:

```csv
min_value,max_value
1000.0,5000000.0
```

---

**Alternative: Using Excel for Analysis**

**Steps:**

1. **Open the CSV File in Excel:**
   - Load `IDSData.csv` into Excel.

2. **Filter Data for Russia:**
   - Apply a filter to the `Country Name` column and select **"Russian Federation"**.

3. **Unpivot the Year Columns (if necessary):**
   - Use Excel's **Power Query** feature to unpivot year columns into a `Year` column.

4. **Filter for Year and Exclude NULL Values:**
   - Filter the `Year` column to show only **2020**.
   - Exclude rows where `Value` is empty or `NULL`.

5. **Calculate Min and Max:**
   - Use Excel's `MIN` and `MAX` functions on the `Value` column to find the minimum and maximum values.

---

**Conclusion:**

By analyzing the data locally, you can overcome BigQuery's quota limitations and obtain the minimum and maximum debt values for Russia in 2020.

2025-01-20 10:51:21 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 10:51:21 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when attempting to execute your SQL query in BigQuery:

```sql
-- Unfortunately, we cannot adjust this SQL further to prevent the quota exceeded error.

-- Original SQL:
SELECT MIN(`value`) AS min_value, MAX(`value`) AS max_value
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_name` = 'Russian Federation'
  AND `year` = 2020;
```

**Error Message:**
```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

The error indicates that your query exceeds the data processing limits set by BigQuery's free tier:

- **Large Dataset Size:** The `international_debt` table is substantial in size.
- **Data Scanned vs. Rows Returned:** Filtering with `WHERE` clauses does not significantly reduce the initial data scanned because BigQuery scans the relevant data before applying filters.
- **Non-Partitioned Columns:** Filtering on columns that aren't partitioned (like `country_name` and `year`) doesn't effectively reduce data scanned.

As a result, even optimized queries may exceed your project's quota.

---

### **Alternative Solutions**

Since adjusting the SQL query further isn't resolving the quota issue, here are two viable alternatives:

#### **1. Analyze the Data Locally**

**Steps:**

1. **Download the Dataset from the World Bank Open Data Portal:**

   - **Access the Dataset:**
     - Visit the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/international-debt-statistics).
     - Find the **"International Debt Statistics"** dataset.

   - **Download the Data:**
     - Download the dataset in **CSV** format (usually named `IDSData.csv` or similar).

2. **Load and Process the Data Using Python and Pandas:**

   **Install Pandas (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

   **Python Code to Analyze the Data:**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the dataset (adjust the file name if necessary)
   df = pd.read_csv('IDSData.csv', skiprows=4)

   # Filter for Russian Federation
   df_russia = df[df['Country Name'] == 'Russian Federation']

   # Unpivot the data to transform year columns into rows
   df_long = df_russia.melt(
       id_vars=['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Indicator Name', 'Indicator Code'],
       var_name='Year',
       value_name='Value'
   )

   # Convert 'Year' and 'Value' to numeric types
   df_long['Year'] = pd.to_numeric(df_long['Year'], errors='coerce')
   df_long['Value'] = pd.to_numeric(df_long['Value'], errors='coerce')

   # Filter for the year 2020 and exclude NULL values
   df_2020 = df_long[
       (df_long['Year'] == 2020) &
       (df_long['Value'].notnull())
   ]

   # Find the minimum and maximum 'Value'
   min_value = df_2020['Value'].min()
   max_value = df_2020['Value'].max()

   # Present the results
   print('```csv')
   print('min_value,max_value')
   print(f'{min_value},{max_value}')
   print('```')
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Loading the Data:**
     - Reads the CSV file into a DataFrame.
     - `skiprows=4` skips metadata rows.

   - **Filtering for Russia:**
     - Selects rows where `Country Name` is `'Russian Federation'`.

   - **Transforming the Data:**
     - `melt` function converts year columns into a single `Year` column, aligning with the data structure you need.

   - **Data Cleaning:**
     - Ensures `Year` and `Value` are numeric for accurate filtering and calculations.

   - **Filtering and Excluding NULLs:**
     - Filters data for the year 2020.
     - Excludes records where `Value` is NULL.

   - **Calculating Min and Max Values:**
     - Uses pandas functions `min()` and `max()` to find the minimum and maximum debt values.

   - **Presenting the Results:**
     - Prints the results in the specified CSV format.

   **Sample Output:**

   Assuming the calculations result in:

   ```csv
   min_value,max_value
   500000.0,2500000000.0
   ```

   **Note:** Replace these values with the actual results from your analysis.

3. **Alternative Tools:**

   - **Excel:** If you prefer, you can perform similar analysis using Excel by:
     - Loading the CSV file.
     - Filtering for `Country Name` as `'Russian Federation'`.
     - Unpivoting the year columns (using Power Query's **Unpivot** feature).
     - Filtering for `Year` = 2020 and excluding NULL values.
     - Using the `MIN` and `MAX` functions on the `Value` column.

#### **2. Enable Billing on BigQuery**

If analyzing the data locally isn't feasible, consider enabling billing on your BigQuery project.

**Steps:**

1. **Enable Billing:**

   - **Add a Billing Account:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing Section](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Follow the instructions to set up a billing account.

   - **Set Budgets and Alerts:**
     - Configure budgets to monitor spending.
     - Set up alerts to notify you when spending reaches certain thresholds.

2. **Run Your Query:**

   - With billing enabled, you can execute your original query without hitting the free tier quota limits.

   **Caution:** BigQuery charges \$5 per terabyte of data processed. Monitor your usage to manage costs.

---

### **Final Answer:**

After performing the analysis locally, present your findings in the required format:

```csv
min_value,max_value
[your_min_value],[your_max_value]
```

**Example:**

```csv
min_value,max_value
500000.0,2500000000.0
```

*Replace `[your_min_value]` and `[your_max_value]` with the actual values obtained from your analysis.*

Task: How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0 (excluding NULL values), you need to count the records in the `international_debt` table where `country_name` is "Russian Federation", `value` equals 0, and `value` is not NULL..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'world_bank_global_population': ['population_by_country'], 'world_bank_health_population': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'health_nutrition_population', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_debt': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_debt', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_education': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_education', 'series_summary'], 'world_bank_wdi': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'footnotes', 'indicators_data', 'series_summary', 'series_time']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 10:59:38 - root - INFO - I'm sorry, but it's not possible to correct the SQL query further to avoid the "Quota exceeded" error. The error indicates that the query exceeds the amount of data allowed to be processed under your current BigQuery quota. Even with filters applied, the dataset is too large to process within the free tier limits.

To resolve this issue, you might consider the following options:

- **Enable Billing**: Upgrade your BigQuery project by enabling billing. This will increase your query processing quota and allow you to run larger queries.

- **Reduce Data Scope**: Further limit the data being queried by selecting specific indicators, years, or additional filters. For example, querying a specific `indicator_code` or a narrower range of years may reduce the data size sufficiently.

- **Use a Smaller Dataset**: If possible, extract the relevant subset of data (e.g., data for "Russian Federation") into a smaller table or dataset and run your query against that.

Here's an example of how you might limit the data further by selecting a specific `indicator_code` and a specific year:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `indicator_code`) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE `country_code` = 'RUS'
  AND `value` = 0
  AND `value` IS NOT NULL
  AND `indicator_code` = 'DT.DOD.DECT.CD'  -- Replace with a specific indicator code
  AND `year` = 2020;
```

However, even with these additional filters, you may still encounter the quota error if the data processed exceeds your project's limits.

**Alternative Approach:**

If you cannot enable billing or further reduce the data scope, consider using the World Bank's [API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889386-developer-information-overview) to retrieve the data you need. The API allows you to request specific data points without processing large datasets.

**Example using World Bank API:**

You can retrieve the list of debt indicators and their values for Russia with a simple API call:

```
https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/RUS/indicator/DT.*?format=json&per_page=1000
```

This API call fetches debt-related indicators (`DT.*`) for Russia. You can then process the JSON response to count the number of indicators with a value of 0.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or guidance on how to proceed.
