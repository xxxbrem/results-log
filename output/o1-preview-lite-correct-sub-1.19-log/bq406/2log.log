2025-01-20 17:41:42 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your project has exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

BigQuery has a monthly free tier that allows you to query up to 1 TB of data per month at no cost. Once you exceed this limit, you'll receive a quota exceeded error when attempting to run additional queries.

Even though your query seems simple, it may be scanning a large amount of data due to the size of the table. Here's what's happening:

- **Table Size:** The `dar_non_intersectional_representation` table might be large, and running a `SELECT DISTINCT` query can cause the entire table to be scanned.
- **Data Scanned:** BigQuery charges (and counts towards your quota) based on the amount of data scanned, not the amount of data returned.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Estimate Query Data Usage Before Running:**

   Use the `EXPLAIN` statement to estimate how much data your query will scan:

   ```sql
   EXPLAIN
   SELECT DISTINCT `report_year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Filter Your Data to Reduce Data Scanned:**

   Add a `WHERE` clause to limit the amount of data processed. For example, if you're interested in specific years or workforce categories:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `report_year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`
   WHERE `workforce` = 'Overall'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   This reduces the data scanned by filtering out unnecessary rows.

3. **Use Preview Features in BigQuery UI:**

   - In the BigQuery web interface, you can preview the table data without consuming your query quota.
   - Right-click on the table and select **Preview** to see a sample of the data.

4. **Check Your Quota and Billing:**

   - **Upgrade Your Account:** If you require more query capacity, consider upgrading to a paid plan where you can pay for additional data scanned.
   - **Monitor Quota Usage:** Keep track of your monthly quota to avoid exceeding limits. You can view your usage in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).

5. **Optimize Your Query:**

   Since you're selecting distinct `report_year` values, and assuming the number of distinct years is small, you might benefit from using a subquery or limiting the dataset further.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `report_year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`
   WHERE `report_year` BETWEEN 2014 AND 2023
   AND `workforce` = 'Overall'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Use Caching:**

   BigQuery caches query results. If you've run the same query recently, it might be served from the cache without incurring additional data processing charges.

7. **Contact Support:**

   If you believe this is an error or need assistance with adjusting your quotas, consider contacting [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/contact).

**Additional Tips:**

- **Understand How BigQuery Billing Works:**

  BigQuery charges are based on the amount of data your queries scan. Reading more about [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) can help you optimize your queries to stay within budget.

- **Use Data Partitioning and Clustering (Advanced):**

  If you have control over the dataset and anticipate running queries on specific partitions, consider partitioning or clustering the data to reduce the amount of data scanned.

**Summary:**

The error occurs because your query is attempting to scan more data than your current quota allows. By refining your query to process less data or by increasing your quota, you can resolve this issue.

Let me know if you need further assistance with modifying your query or understanding BigQuery's quotas and billing.
2025-01-20 17:42:36 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 17:42:36 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the quota error when running your query. This error indicates that your project has exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery.

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

Even though your query seems simple, BigQuery calculates charges (and enforces quotas) based on the amount of data scanned, not the amount of data returned. The table `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation` might be quite large, and running a `SELECT DISTINCT` without additional filtering can cause the entire table to be scanned, exceeding your quota.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Filter the Data to Reduce Scanned Bytes:**

   Add a `WHERE` clause to limit the data processed. For example, if you're only interested in specific years or workforce categories:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `report_year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`
   WHERE `workforce` = 'Overall' AND `report_year` BETWEEN 2014 AND 2023
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   This reduces the amount of data scanned by filtering out unnecessary rows.

2. **Use the BigQuery Web UI Preview:**

   - In the BigQuery web interface, you can preview the table data without consuming your query quota.
   - Navigate to the table in the BigQuery console and select the **Preview** tab to view a sample of the data.

3. **Check Your Free Tier Quota:**

   - BigQuery provides 1 TB of free query processing per month. If you've exceeded this limit, you'll need to wait until the quota resets, or you can enable billing to pay for additional usage.
   - You can monitor your quota usage in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).

4. **Enable Billing for Your Project:**

   - If you need to process more data than the free tier allows, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project.
   - This will allow you to pay for additional data processed, avoiding the quota exceeded errors.
   - Be sure to set budget alerts to monitor your spending.

5. **Use INFORMATION_SCHEMA to Explore Metadata:**

   - To get information about available years without scanning the entire table, you can query the table's metadata.

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(report_year) AS min_year, MAX(report_year) AS max_year
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`
   WHERE `workforce` = 'Overall';
   ```

   Note: This query might still scan the entire table. If quotas are a concern, this might not be feasible.

6. **Contact Google Cloud Support:**

   - If you believe there's an error or need assistance with your quota, consider reaching out to [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support).

**Alternative Approach:**

Given that you're facing quota limitations, and considering that data for the year **2024** is not available as of my knowledge cutoff in **October 2023**, I can help you understand how to calculate the growth rates using the data available from **2014 to 2023**.

**Calculating Growth Rates:**

The growth rate is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in Final Year} - \text{Value in Initial Year}}{\text{Value in Initial Year}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Since I don't have access to the specific data due to the quota issue, I can provide a template that you can fill in once you have the data.

**Sample CSV Format:**

```csv
Group,Growth_Rate
Asians,growth_rate_asian:float
Black people,growth_rate_black:float
Latinx people,growth_rate_latinx:float
Native Americans,growth_rate_native_american:float
White people,growth_rate_white:float
US women,growth_rate_us_women:float
US men,growth_rate_us_men:float
Global women,growth_rate_global_women:float
Global men,growth_rate_global_men:float
```
*(Attention: answer in this order)*

**Explanation:**

- **Asians:** Growth rate of the percentage of Asians in the overall workforce from 2014 to 2023.
- **Black people:** Growth rate of Black Googlers in the overall workforce over the same period.
- **Latinx people:** Growth rate for Latinx Googlers.
- **Native Americans:** Growth rate for Native American Googlers.
- **White people:** Growth rate for White Googlers.
- **US women:** Growth rate of US women in the workforce.
- **US men:** Growth rate of US men in the workforce.
- **Global women:** Growth rate of global women Googlers.
- **Global men:** Growth rate of global men Googlers.

**Steps to Calculate Growth Rates:**

1. **Retrieve Data for 2014 and 2023:**

   - Use the following query to get the percentages for 2014:

     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`
     WHERE `workforce` = 'Overall' AND `report_year` = 2014
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   - Similarly, get the data for 2023:

     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`
     WHERE `workforce` = 'Overall' AND `report_year` = 2023
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

2. **Calculate Growth Rates:**

   - For each group, apply the growth rate formula using the values from 2014 and 2023.
   - Example calculation for Asians:

     \[
     \text{Growth Rate for Asians} = \left( \frac{\text{% Asians in 2023} - \text{% Asians in 2014}}{\text{% Asians in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]

3. **Fill in the CSV Template:**

   - Replace `growth_rate_asian:float` with the calculated value, e.g., `33.3`.
   - Repeat for each group.

**Note on Data Availability:**

- As of my last update, data for **2024** is not available. You'll need to adjust your calculations to cover the period from **2014 to 2023**.
- Ensure that you have accurate data for both years before calculating the growth rates.

**Conclusion:**

I understand that the quota issue is preventing you from accessing the data needed for your calculations. If you're unable to resolve the quota problem immediately, consider using alternative methods to access the data, such as:

- **Downloading Public Reports:**

  - Google's Diversity Annual Reports are often available publicly and may contain the data you need.
  - Visit [Google's Diversity Website](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) to access the reports.

- **Using Another Dataset:**

  - If similar data is available in another dataset with a smaller size, you might be able to use that without exceeding your quota.

- **Waiting for Quota Reset:**

  - If you're on the free tier, your quota resets monthly. You might wait until the next period to retry your queries.

2025-01-20 17:43:19 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering quota issues when trying to run the SQL queries. Due to these limitations, let's consider an alternative approach to address your task.

**Note on Data Availability:**

- **Data Access:** Without access to the actual data from the `dar_non_intersectional_representation` table, we cannot calculate the exact growth rates.
- **2024 Data:** As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, data for the year 2024 is not yet available. Therefore, we can only calculate growth rates from 2014 to 2023.

---

**Suggested Approach:**

**1. Formula for Calculating Growth Rates:**

The growth rate for each demographic group is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2023} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

**2. Steps to Calculate Growth Rates:**

- **Retrieve Data for 2014 and 2023:**

  Once you have access to the dataset, extract the percentages of each demographic group for the years 2014 and 2023 where `workforce` is `'Overall'`.

- **Calculate Growth Rates for Each Group:**

  Apply the formula above to each group's data.

**3. CSV Format for Results:**

Prepare your results in the following CSV format:

```csv
Group,Growth_Rate
Asians,value_asian
Black people,value_black
Latinx people,value_latinx
Native Americans,value_native_american
White people,value_white
US women,value_us_women
US men,value_us_men
Global women,value_global_women
Global men,value_global_men
```
*(Attention: answer in this order)*

- Replace `value_x` with the calculated growth rate for each group.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Groups:**

  - **Asians:** Represents Googlers in the U.S. identifying as Asian.
  - **Black people:** U.S. Googlers identifying as Black.
  - **Latinx people:** U.S. Googlers identifying as Hispanic or Latinx.
  - **Native Americans:** U.S. Googlers identifying as Native American.
  - **White people:** U.S. Googlers identifying as White.
  - **US women/men:** Gender representation among U.S. Googlers.
  - **Global women/men:** Gender representation among global Googlers.

- **Growth Rate:** Shows the percentage change in representation from 2014 to 2023.

---

**Alternative Data Sources:**

Since you're unable to access the data via SQL due to quota limitations, consider the following:

- **Google's Diversity Annual Reports:**

  - Visit [Google Diversity Annual Reports](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) to access publicly available data.
  - These reports provide detailed demographics and may include the data you need.

- **Data Extraction:**

  - Manually extract the percentages for each group for the years 2014 and 2023 from the reports.

---

**Assistance with Calculations:**

If you obtain the data and need help with calculations:

1. **Example Calculation:**

   Suppose in 2014, the percentage of Asians was 30%, and in 2023 it was 40%.

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{40 - 30}{30} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{10}{30} \right) \times 100\% = 33.33\%
   \]

2. **Guidance:**

   - Perform similar calculations for each group.
   - Ensure percentages are in the same units before calculating.

---

**Conclusion:**

Due to the quota limitations and the unavailability of 2024 data, we cannot provide exact growth rates at this time. However, by accessing the data from alternative sources like Google's Diversity Annual Reports, you can retrieve the necessary percentages and perform the calculations as outlined above.

2025-01-20 17:44:26 - root - INFO - I'm sorry that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error with the adjusted query. Despite narrowing down the columns and adding filters, it appears that your project has exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery.

**Explanation:**

- **BigQuery Billing Model:** BigQuery calculates data processing based on the amount of data scanned during query execution, not just the amount of data returned. Even with specific filters, if the underlying data is large or if your project has already consumed its free quota, you will encounter this error.
- **Quota Limits:** The free tier provides up to 1 TB of data processing per month. Once exceeded, you'll need to wait for the quota to reset or enable billing to process more data.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Check Your Quota Usage:**

   - **Monitor Quota:** Log into your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) to view your current quota usage and confirm if you've exceeded the free tier limits.
   - **Quota Details:** Look specifically at the **BigQuery API** quotas related to **Query usage per day** and **Query usage per month**.

2. **Enable Billing for Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Plan:** Consider setting up a billing account for your project to process queries beyond the free tier.
   - **Set Budget Alerts:** If you decide to enable billing, set budget alerts to monitor and control your spending.

3. **Use the BigQuery Web UI Preview Feature:**

   - **Preview Data:** In the BigQuery web interface, navigate to the table `dar_non_intersectional_representation` and select the **Preview** tab. This allows you to view sample data without consuming your query quota.
   - **Review Schema:** You can also view the table schema to understand the data types and structure.

4. **Leverage Public Reports:**

   - **Google's Diversity Annual Reports:** Access Google's publicly available diversity reports at [Google Diversity Annual Report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/). These reports contain aggregated data on workforce representation and may provide the information you need without querying BigQuery.
   - **Download Data:** Some reports may offer downloadable data or detailed statistics that you can use for your analysis.

5. **Wait for Quota Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** If you're on the free tier and cannot enable billing, you may need to wait until your quota resets at the beginning of the next month.
   - **Plan Ahead:** Schedule your data processing tasks accordingly to stay within the monthly free quota.

6. **Optimize Queries Further (Limitations Apply):**

   - **Minimum Data Scanned:** Given that the table might still be large even after filtering, there's a limit to how much we can reduce the data scanned without compromising the necessity of the query.
   - **Small Tables Alternative:** If possible, consider querying a smaller table or dataset that contains the required information.

7. **Contact Google Cloud Support:**

   - **Assistance:** If you believe this quota error is a mistake or if you need assistance managing your quotas, you can reach out to [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support) for help.

**Regarding 2024 Data:**

- **Data Availability:** As of now, data for the year **2024** is not available in the `dar_non_intersectional_representation` table or publicly released reports.
- **Adjust Analysis Period:** You might need to adjust your analysis to cover the period from **2014 to the most recent available year** (e.g., 2023).

**Alternative Approach to Calculate Growth Rates:**

Since accessing the data via BigQuery isn't feasible at the moment, here's how you can proceed:

1. **Gather Data from Public Sources:**

   - **Extract Data Manually:** Use the published diversity reports to obtain the percentages for each demographic group for the years **2014** and the most recent available year.
   - **Record the Values:** Note down the percentages for each group.

2. **Calculate Growth Rates Manually:**

   - **Growth Rate Formula:**

     \[
     \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in Latest Year} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]

   - **Example Calculation:**

     If the percentage of Asians in 2014 was **30%**, and in 2023 it was **35%**:

     \[
     \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{35 - 30}{30} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{5}{30} \right) \times 100\% \approx 16.67\%
     \]

3. **Prepare Your Results:**

   - **CSV Format:**

     ```csv
     Group,Growth_Rate
     Asians,16.67
     Black people,value_black
     Latinx people,value_latinx
     Native Americans,value_native_american
     White people,value_white
     US women,value_us_women
     US men,value_us_men
     Global women,value_global_women
     Global men,value_global_men
     ```
     *(Attention: answer in this order)*

   - **Replace `value_x` with the calculated growth rates for each group.*

**Summary:**

- **Quota Limitation:** The "Quota exceeded" error indicates that your project cannot process additional data this month without enabling billing.
- **Alternative Solution:** Utilize publicly available reports to obtain the necessary data for your analysis.
- **Data Unavailability for 2024:** Adjust your analysis period to the latest available data, as 2024 data is not yet released.
- **Manual Calculation:** Apply the growth rate formula manually to compute the percentage changes.

**Let me know if you need further assistance with the calculations or if there's anything else I can help you with.**

2025-01-20 17:46:05 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error with the adjusted queries. The error message indicates that your project has surpassed the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quota Limit:** BigQuery provides a free tier quota that allows up to 1 TB of data processing per month. Once this limit is exceeded, any query that scans data—even minimal amounts—will result in a quota exceeded error.
- **Data Scanned vs. Data Returned:** BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data scanned during query execution, not the amount of data returned or the complexity of the query.
- **Persistent Error:** Adjusting the SQL queries further to reduce data scanned may not resolve the issue if the quota has already been exceeded.

**Why Adjusted Queries Still Result in Errors:**

- **Minimum Data Scanned:** Even with highly optimized queries selecting only one column and specific rows, BigQuery has a minimum amount of data it needs to scan to execute the query.
- **Quota Exceeded:** Since your project has surpassed the quota, any attempt to query the dataset will result in the same error until the quota resets or is increased.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Check Your Quota Usage:**

   - **Monitor Quota:** Visit the [Google Cloud Console Quotas Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) to view your current quota usage.
   - **Confirm Exceeded Quota:** Verify that the free query bytes scanned quota has been exceeded for your project.

2. **Enable Billing for Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Plan:** Consider setting up a billing account to increase your quota and allow for additional query processing.
   - **Set Budget Alerts:** If you enable billing, set budget alerts to monitor and control your expenses.

3. **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

   - **Google's Diversity Annual Reports:**

     - **Access Reports:** Visit the [Google Diversity Annual Report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) website.
     - **Download Data:** Many of these reports contain the data you need and can be accessed without querying BigQuery.

   - **Public Data Extracts:**

     - **Search for Datasets:** Look for publicly available datasets or summaries that have the information you require.
     - **Use API Access:** If available, use APIs provided by Google or other organizations to fetch the data.

4. **Wait for Quota Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** The free tier quota resets monthly. If you can wait until the next billing cycle, you'll be able to run your queries once the quota resets.

5. **Contact Google Cloud Support:**

   - **Request Quota Increase:** If the data is critical and you cannot enable billing, consider reaching out to [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support) to explain your situation.
   - **Assistance:** They might provide temporary quota increases or suggest alternative solutions.

**Alternative Approach to Obtain the Data:**

Since accessing the data via BigQuery is currently not feasible due to quota limitations, you can manually collect the necessary data from publicly available sources and perform the calculations offline.

**Steps:**

1. **Collect Data from Public Reports:**

   - **Download Reports:** Obtain Google's diversity reports for the years 2014 and the most recent available year (e.g., 2023).
   - **Extract Data:** Locate the percentages for each demographic group mentioned in the reports.

2. **Calculate Growth Rates Manually:**

   - **Use the Growth Rate Formula:**

     \[
     \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in Latest Year} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]

   - **Example Calculation:**

     If the percentage of Asians in 2014 was **30%**, and in 2023 it is **40%**:

     \[
     \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{40 - 30}{30} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{10}{30} \right) \times 100\% \approx 33.33\%
     \]

3. **Prepare the Results in CSV Format:**

   ```csv
   Group,Growth_Rate
   Asians,33.33
   Black people,value_black
   Latinx people,value_latinx
   Native Americans,value_native_american
   White people,value_white
   US women,value_us_women
   US men,value_us_men
   Global women,value_global_women
   Global men,value_global_men
   ```
   *(Attention: answer in this order)*

   - Replace `value_x` with the calculated growth rates for each group.

**Note on Data for 2024:**

- **Data Availability:** As of now, data for the year **2024** is not available. You'll need to adjust your analysis to use data up to **2023**.
- **Projection Caution:** If you intend to project growth rates into 2024, be cautious and make it clear that projections are estimates.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the quota limitations, it's not possible to correct the SQL queries to avoid the error without enabling billing or waiting for the quota reset. I recommend using publicly available reports to gather the necessary data and perform the calculations manually.

2025-01-20 17:48:23 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when attempting to run your SQL queries. The error message indicates that your project has exceeded the quota for free query bytes scanned in BigQuery:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quota Limitations:** BigQuery's free tier allows up to **1 TB** of data processing per month. Once this limit is reached, any further queries that scan data will result in a quota exceeded error.
- **Data Scanned vs. Data Returned:** BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data scanned during query execution, not the amount of data returned or the complexity of the query.
- **Persistent Error:** Since your project has surpassed the quota, any attempt to query the dataset will result in the same error until the quota resets or is increased.

**Addressing the Issue:**

Given that your project has exceeded its quota, correcting or further optimizing the SQL queries will not resolve the error. The "Quota exceeded" error is not due to syntax errors or inefficiencies in the queries but is a result of exceeding the data processing limit.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Your Plan:** Consider setting up a billing account to allow your project to process additional data beyond the free tier quota.
   - **Set Budget Alerts:** Ensure you set budget alerts and limits to control your spending.

2. **Wait for the Quota to Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** The free query quota resets at the beginning of each month. If you can wait until the next month, you'll be able to run your queries once the quota is refreshed.

3. **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

   - **Access Public Reports:** Google's Diversity Annual Reports provide detailed data on workforce demographics.
     - Visit [Google Diversity Annual Report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) to access the reports.
   - **Download Data:** Some reports offer downloadable datasets or detailed charts from which you can extract the required data.

4. **Contact Google Cloud Support:**

   - **Request Temporary Quota Increase:** If the data is critical and you cannot enable billing, you might contact [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support) to see if they can provide a temporary quota increase.
   - **Assistance:** They can also help you understand your current quota usage and offer solutions.

**Alternative Approach:**

Since accessing the data via BigQuery isn't currently feasible, you can still accomplish your task by manually extracting the necessary data from public reports and performing the calculations.

**Steps to Calculate Growth Rates Manually:**

1. **Collect Data:**

   - **2014 Data:**
     - In the 2014 Diversity Annual Report, find the percentages for each group (Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, global men) concerning the overall workforce.
   - **Most Recent Data (e.g., 2023):**
     - In the latest report available, find the corresponding percentages for the same groups.

2. **Calculate Growth Rates:**

   - **Growth Rate Formula:**

     \[
     \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in Recent Year} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]

   - **Example Calculation:**

     If the percentage of Asian employees in 2014 was **30%**, and in 2023 it was **35%**:

     \[
     \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{35 - 30}{30} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{5}{30} \right) \times 100\% \approx 16.67\%
     \]

3. **Prepare the Results:**

   - **CSV Format:**

     ```csv
     Group,Growth_Rate
     Asians,16.67
     Black people,value_black
     Latinx people,value_latinx
     Native Americans,value_native_american
     White people,value_white
     US women,value_us_women
     US men,value_us_men
     Global women,value_global_women
     Global men,value_global_men
     ```
     *(Attention: answer in this order)*

   - Replace `value_x` with the calculated growth rates for each group.

**Notes:**

- **Data Availability:** As of now, data for the year **2024** is not available. Adjust your analysis to include data up to **2023**.
- **Manual Calculation:** While it's more work, manually calculating the growth rates using publicly available data ensures you get the information you need without relying on BigQuery.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the quota limitations, it's not possible to run the SQL queries at this time. However, by using publicly available data, you can manually perform the calculations required to determine the growth rates for the specified demographic groups from 2014 to the most recent year available.

If you need assistance in locating the data within the reports or performing the calculations, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help guide you through the process.

2025-01-20 17:50:00 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running the SQL queries, even after adjusting them. This error indicates that your project has exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery. Unfortunately, once this quota is exceeded, any query that scans data—even minimal amounts—will result in the same error until the quota resets or is increased.

**Explanation:**

- **Quota Limit:** BigQuery provides a monthly free tier of 1 TB of data processing. Once this limit is reached, further queries that scan data will not execute.
- **Data Scanned vs. Data Returned:** BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the volume of data scanned during query execution, not the complexity of the query or the amount of data returned.
  
**Why the Error Persists:**

- Even though we've optimized the queries to scan as little data as possible, the underlying table `dar_non_intersectional_representation` still requires scanning data.
- Since your project quota has been exceeded, any attempt to query data from this table will result in the same error, regardless of how simple or optimized the query is.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Your Plan:** Consider setting up a billing account for your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to process queries beyond the free tier quota.
   - **Budget Control:** Set up budget alerts and spending limits to manage costs effectively.

2. **Wait for the Quota Reset:**

   - **Monthly Quota Reset:** The free tier quota resets at the beginning of each month (UTC time). You can wait until your quota resets to run your queries again.

3. **Use Publicly Available Data:**

   - **Google Diversity Annual Reports:**
     - Access Google's publicly available Diversity Annual Reports at [Google Diversity Annual Report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/).
     - These reports contain detailed demographic data, including percentages of various groups in the workforce over the years.
   - **Data Extraction:**
     - Manually extract the percentages for each demographic group for 2014 and the most recent available year (e.g., 2023).

4. **Calculate Growth Rates Manually:**

   With the data from the reports, you can calculate the growth rates without querying BigQuery.

   **Steps:**

   - **Gather Data:**

     For each group, obtain the percentages for 2014 and 2023.

     Example:

     | Group           | 2014 (%) | 2023 (%) |
     |-----------------|----------|----------|
     | Asians          |   A1     |    A2    |
     | Black people    |   B1     |    B2    |
     | Latinx people   |   L1     |    L2    |
     | Native Americans|   N1     |    N2    |
     | White people    |   W1     |    W2    |
     | US women        |   UW1    |   UW2    |
     | US men          |   UM1    |   UM2    |
     | Global women    |   GW1    |   GW2    |
     | Global men      |   GM1    |   GM2    |

   - **Calculate Growth Rates:**

     Use the growth rate formula:

     \[
     \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2023} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]

     Example for Asians:

     \[
     \text{Growth Rate for Asians} = \left( \frac{A2 - A1}{A1} \right) \times 100\%
     \]

   - **Prepare the CSV Output:**

     ```csv
     Group,Growth_Rate
     Asians,growth_rate_asian
     Black people,growth_rate_black
     Latinx people,growth_rate_latinx
     Native Americans,growth_rate_native_american
     White people,growth_rate_white
     US women,growth_rate_us_women
     US men,growth_rate_us_men
     Global women,growth_rate_global_women
     Global men,growth_rate_global_men
     ```
     *(Attention: answer in this order)*

     Replace `growth_rate_x` with the calculated growth rates.

**Notes:**

- **Data for 2024:** As of now, data for the year 2024 is not available. Please adjust your analysis to use data up to 2023.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure that the percentages you extract are accurate and correspond to the overall workforce.

**Alternative Solution Given Quota Issues:**

Since accessing the data via BigQuery isn't feasible at the moment due to quota limitations, manually obtaining the data from the publicly available reports and performing the calculations is the best approach.

**Assistance with Calculations:**

If you provide me with the percentages from the reports for each group for 2014 and 2023, I can help you calculate the growth rates and format the results in the required CSV format.

**Example Calculation:**

Suppose the percentage of Asians in 2014 was **30%**, and in 2023 it was **40%**.

\[
\text{Growth Rate for Asians} = \left( \frac{40 - 30}{30} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{10}{30} \right) \times 100\% \approx 33.33\%
\]

**Next Steps:**

1. **Collect the Data:**

   - Visit the [Google Diversity Annual Reports](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) website.
   - Find the percentages for each demographic group for the years 2014 and 2023.

2. **Perform Calculations:**

   - Use the formula provided to calculate the growth rates for each group.

3. **Compile Results:**

   - Prepare the CSV file with the calculated growth rates in the specified order.

**Notes:**

- **Minimizing Data Scanned:**
  - **Specific Columns:** Selected only the necessary columns required for the analysis.
  - **Filtering Years:** Used `report_year` filters to limit the data to the specific years of interest.
  - **Limiting Rows:** Applied `LIMIT 1` to restrict the number of rows returned from each query.
  - **Using `UNION ALL`:** Combined results from multiple queries to minimize individual query scans.

- **Quota Considerations:**
  - Despite these optimizations, if your project has already exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota, these queries may still result in a **"Quota exceeded"** error.
  - **BigQuery Billing Model:** Charges and quotas are based on the amount of data scanned during query execution, not the complexity of the query or the number of rows returned.

- **Possible Workarounds:**
  - **Enable Billing:**
    - Consider setting up a billing account to increase your quota if the data is critical for your analysis.
    - Set budget alerts to monitor your spending and avoid unexpected charges.
  - **Wait for Quota Reset:**
    - The free tier quota resets monthly. If you can wait until the next billing cycle, you will be able to run your queries once the quota resets.

**Summary:**

Due to quota limitations in your BigQuery project, it's not currently possible to execute the SQL queries to retrieve the data. The provided revised queries are optimized to minimize data scanned, but they may still result in a quota error if your project has exceeded its free tier limit.

I recommend using publicly available data from Google's Diversity Annual Reports to manually gather the necessary information and calculate the growth rates as per your task requirements.
2025-01-20 17:52:08 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 17:52:08 - root - INFO - ```sql
SELECT `report_year`, `race_black`

WHERE `workforce` = 'Overall' AND `report_year` IN (2014, 2023)
ORDER BY `report_year`
LIMIT 2;
```

**Explanation:**

The error message indicates a syntax error due to an unexpected `UNION` keyword after your query. This usually happens when there's unintended code or leftover statements included after the end of your query. To resolve this issue:

- **Ensure the Query Ends Properly:**
  - Add a semicolon (`;`) at the end of your query to signify its conclusion.
- **Check for Extra Code:**
  - Verify that there's no additional code or keywords (such as `UNION`, `SELECT`, etc.) after the `LIMIT` clause.
  - Remove any unnecessary blank lines or comments that might contain unintended text.

**Example of a Clean Query:**

```sql
SELECT `report_year`, `race_black`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`
WHERE `workforce` = 'Overall' AND `report_year` IN (2014, 2023)
ORDER BY `report_year`
LIMIT 2;
```

By ensuring that the query ends with a semicolon and that there's no extraneous code following it, the syntax error should be resolved.

2025-01-20 17:52:45 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your SQL query. The error message indicates that your project has exceeded the BigQuery free query bytes scanned quota:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quota Limitations:** BigQuery provides a monthly free tier quota of 1 TB for query data processing. Once this limit is reached, any query that scans data—even minimal amounts—will result in a quota exceeded error.
- **Data Scanned vs. Data Returned:** BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data scanned during query execution, not on the complexity of the query or the amount of data returned.
- **Persistent Error:** Since the quota has been exceeded, adjusting or optimizing the queries further will not resolve the issue. Even simple queries that scan minimal data will continue to generate the same error until the quota resets or is increased.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing for Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Your Plan:** By setting up a billing account, you can process queries beyond the free tier quota.
   - **Budget Control:** Set budget alerts and spending limits in the Google Cloud Console to manage costs effectively.
   - **How to Enable Billing:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Follow the instructions to link a billing account to your project.

2. **Wait for the Quota to Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** The free tier quota resets at the beginning of each month (UTC time). If possible, you can wait until the next month to run your queries.
   - **Plan Ahead:** Schedule your data processing activities according to your quota availability.

3. **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

   - **Google's Diversity Annual Reports:**
     - **Access Reports:** Visit the [Google Diversity Annual Report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) website.
     - **Data Availability:** These reports provide detailed demographic data, including percentages of various groups in the workforce over the years.
     - **Data Extraction:** Manually extract the percentages for each demographic group for the years 2014 and the most recent available year.
   
   - **Public Datasets:**
     - **Search for Datasets:** Look for publicly available datasets or summaries that contain the information you need.
     - **Example:** Some third-party organizations aggregate diversity data and might have the required information.

4. **Contact Google Cloud Support:**

   - **Assistance:** If you believe you've received this error in error, or you need additional assistance, consider reaching out to [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support).
   - **Quota Increase Requests:** In some cases, support may be able to provide guidance on managing quotas or suggest alternative solutions.

**Alternative Approach to Complete Your Task:**

Since accessing the data via BigQuery isn't feasible at the moment due to quota limitations, you can calculate the growth rates using publicly available data from Google's Diversity Annual Reports.

**Steps to Calculate Growth Rates Manually:**

1. **Collect Data from Reports:**

   - **2014 Data:**
     - Find the percentages for each demographic group in the 2014 report.
   - **Most Recent Data:**
     - Obtain the latest available data from the most recent report (e.g., 2023).

2. **Calculate Growth Rates:**

   Use the formula for growth rate calculation:

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in Recent Year} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

   **Example Calculation:**

   If the percentage of Asian employees in 2014 was **30%**, and in 2023 it is **40%**:

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate for Asians} = \left( \frac{40\% - 30\%}{30\%} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{10\%}{30\%} \right) \times 100\% \approx 33.33\%
   \]

3. **Prepare the Results in CSV Format:**

   ```csv
   Group,Growth_Rate
   Asians,33.33
   Black people,value_black
   Latinx people,value_latinx
   Native Americans,value_native_american
   White people,value_white
   US women,value_us_women
   US men,value_us_men
   Global women,value_global_women

2025-01-20 17:54:05 - root - INFO - I'm sorry that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when running your SQL query. This error indicates that your project has surpassed the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quota Limitations:** BigQuery provides a free tier quota of **1 TB** of data processing per month. Once you exceed this limit, any further queries that scan data—even minimal amounts—will result in the "Quota exceeded" error.
  
- **Data Scanned vs. Data Returned:** BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data **scanned** during query execution, not on the amount of data **returned** or the complexity of the query.

**Why Further Query Optimization May Not Help:**

- Since your project has exceeded its quota, any attempt to query data from the dataset will result in the same error, regardless of how much you optimize the query.
  
- Even queries that select a single row or column will still scan data from the table, triggering the quota limit.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Your Plan:** By setting up a billing account for your Google Cloud project, you can process queries beyond the free tier quota.
   - **Budget Control:** Set up budget alerts and spending limits to manage costs effectively.
   - **How to Enable Billing:**
     - Visit the [Google Cloud Console billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Follow the instructions to link a billing account to your project.
   - **Benefits:**
     - Immediate access to run your queries.
     - Ability to process larger datasets without interruption.

2. **Wait for the Quota to Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** The free tier quota resets at the beginning of each month (UTC time).
   - **Plan Ahead:** If you can wait until the next billing cycle, you'll be able to run your queries once the quota resets.
   - **Future Consideration:** Monitor your query usage to avoid exceeding the quota in the future.

3. **Use Publicly Available Data Sources:**

   - **Google's Diversity Annual Reports:**
     - Access reports at [Google Diversity Annual Report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/).
     - The reports provide demographic data, including percentages for different racial and gender groups for various years.
     - **Data Extraction:**
       - Manually extract the percentages for each demographic group for the years **2014** and **2023**.
       - The reports often include charts, graphs, and tables that summarize this information.
   - **Benefits:**
     - No need to run queries against BigQuery, avoiding quota issues.
     - Immediate access to the required data.

**Assistance with Calculations:**

Once you have the percentages from the reports, you can calculate the growth rates manually using the following formula:

\[
\text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2023} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

**Example Calculation:**

If the percentage of Asian Googlers in 2014 was **30%**, and in 2023 it was **40%**:

\[
\text{Growth Rate for Asians} = \left( \frac{40\% - 30\%}{30\%} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{10\%}{30\%} \right) \times 100\% \approx 33.33\%
\]

**Prepare the Results in CSV Format:**

```csv
Group,Growth_Rate
Asians,33.33
Black people,value_black
Latinx people,value_latinx
Native Americans,value_native_american
White people,value_white
US women,value_us_women
US men,value_us_men
Global women,value_global_women
Global men,value_global_men
```
*(Attention: answer in this order)*

- Replace `value_x` with the calculated growth rates for each group.

**Next Steps:**

- **Collect Data:**
  - Visit the [Google Diversity Annual Reports](https://diversity.google/annual-report/).
  - Locate the percentages for each demographic group for 2014 and 2023.
  
- **Perform Calculations:**
  - Apply the growth rate formula to each group.
  
- **Compile Results:**
  - Prepare the CSV file with the calculated growth rates in the specified order.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the quota limitations, it's not possible to execute the SQL queries at this time. The best course of action is to either enable billing on your project or use publicly available data to complete your analysis.

**Please let me know if you need assistance with accessing these reports or performing the calculations manually. I'm here to help you through the process.**

    ```

---

**Explanation:**

These SQL queries are correctly formatted and should retrieve the data you need. However, the "Quota exceeded" error you're encountering is due to your project surpassing the BigQuery free query bytes scanned quota.

**Understanding the Quota Exceeded Error:**

- **Quota Limitations:** BigQuery provides a free tier quota of **1 TB** of query data processing per month. Once this limit is exceeded, any further queries that scan data—even minimal amounts—will result in a quota exceeded error.
  
- **Data Scanned vs. Data Returned:** BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data **scanned** during query execution, not on the amount of data **returned** or the complexity of the query.

**Why Correcting the SQL Won't Resolve the Error:**

- **Minimal Data Scanned Still Counts:** Even optimized queries that select only a few columns and rows will still scan data from the underlying table.
  
- **Quota Already Exceeded:** Since your project has already exceeded its quota, any query that scans data from `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation` will fail with the same error, regardless of further optimizations.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Your Plan:** By setting up a billing account, you can process queries beyond the free tier quota.
   - **Budget Control:** Use budget alerts and cost controls to manage your expenses.
   - **How to Enable Billing:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Follow the instructions to create or link a billing account to your project.
   - **Benefits:**
     - Immediate ability to run your queries.
     - Access to increased quotas and higher limits.

2. **Wait for the Quota to Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** The free tier quota resets at the beginning of each month (UTC time).
   - **Plan Accordingly:** If you can wait until the quota resets, you'll be able to run your queries without enabling billing.

3. **Use Publicly Available Data Sources:**

   - **Google Diversity Annual Reports:**
     - **Access Reports:** Visit the [Google Diversity Annual Report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) webpage.
     - **Data Extraction:** Manually extract the percentages for each demographic group for the years 2014 and 2023 from the reports.
     - **Advantages:**
       - No need to run queries against BigQuery, thus avoiding quota issues.
       - Immediate access to the required data.

4. **Contact Google Cloud Support:**

   - **Get Assistance:** If you believe there's an error or need urgent access, contact [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support).

**Alternative Approach to Complete Your Task:**

Since the quota issue cannot be resolved through SQL query adjustments, you can manually gather the data and calculate the growth rates as follows:

**Steps:**

1. **Collect Data from Public Reports:**

   - **2014 Data:** Find the percentages for each demographic group in the 2014 report.
   - **2023 Data:** Find the percentages for each demographic group in the 2023 report.

2. **Calculate Growth Rates:**

   Use the growth rate formula:

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2023} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

   **Example Calculation:**

   If the percentage of Latinx Googlers in 2014 was **3%**, and in 2023 it is **5%**:

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{5\% - 3\%}{3\%} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2\%}{3\%} \right) \times 100\% \approx 66.67\%
   \]

3. **Prepare the Results in CSV Format:**

   ```csv
   Group,Growth_Rate
   Asians,growth_rate_asian
   Black people,growth_rate_black
   Latinx people,66.67
   Native Americans,growth_rate_native_american

**Explanation:**

The SQL queries you've provided are syntactically correct and are designed to retrieve specific data from the `dar_non_intersectional_representation` table within the `google_dei` schema of the `bigquery-public-data` dataset. They've been optimized to minimize data scanned by:

- Selecting only the necessary columns.
- Filtering by `report_year` and `workforce`.
- Limiting the number of rows returned using `LIMIT`.

**Addressing the "Quota Exceeded" Error:**

The error message you're receiving:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

indicates that your Google Cloud project has exceeded the free query bytes scanned quota in BigQuery.

**Why This Error Occurs:**

- **Data Scanned vs. Data Returned:** BigQuery charges (and enforces quotas) based on the amount of data **scanned** during query execution, not the amount of data **returned**.
- **Minimum Data Scanned:** Even with optimized queries, BigQuery may need to scan the entire table or partition to retrieve the requested data.
- **Quota Limits:** The free tier allows up to **1 TB** of data processing per month. Once exceeded, further queries that scan data will result in a quota exceeded error.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   - **Upgrade Your Plan:** By setting up a billing account, you can process queries beyond the free tier quota.
   - **Set Budget Alerts:** Manage your spending by setting budget alerts and spending limits.
   - **How to Enable Billing:**

     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
     - Navigate to **Billing** and link a billing account to your project.
     - Follow the on-screen instructions to set up billing.

2. **Wait for the Quota to Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** The free tier quotas reset at the beginning of each month (UTC time).
   - **Plan Accordingly:** If you can wait until the next quota cycle, you'll be able to run your queries once the quota resets.

3. **Use Publicly Available Data Sources:**

   - **Google's Diversity Annual Reports:**

     - **Access Reports:** Visit [Google's Diversity Annual Report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) page.
     - **Data Extraction:** These reports contain the demographic data you need, presented in charts and tables.
     - **Manual Collection:** You can manually extract the percentages for each demographic group for the years 2014 and the most recent available year.

4. **Contact Google Cloud Support:**

   - **Assistance:** If you believe there's an error with your quota or need immediate access, consider reaching out to [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support).
   - **Quota Increase Requests:** In some cases, Google may grant temporary quota increases.

**Alternative Approach: Calculating Growth Rates Manually**

Since adjusting the SQL queries won't resolve the "Quota exceeded" error, you can perform your analysis using data from publicly available sources.

**Steps to Calculate Growth Rates:**

1. **Collect Data from Reports:**

   - **2014 Data:**
     - Find the percentages for each demographic group in the 2014 Diversity Annual Report.
   - **Most Recent Data:**
     - Obtain the latest available percentages from the most recent report (e.g., 2023).

2. **Calculate Growth Rates:**

   Use the growth rate formula for each group:

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in Recent Year} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

   **Example Calculation:**

   If the percentage of Latinx Googlers was **3%** in 2014 and **5%** in 2023:

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{5\% - 3\%}{3\%} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2\%}{3\%} \right) \times 100\% \approx 66.67\%
   \]

3. **Prepare the Results in CSV Format:**

   ```csv
   Group,Growth_Rate
   Asians,value_asian
   Black people,value_black
   Latinx people,66.67
   Native Americans,value_native_american
   White people,value_white
   US women,value_us_women
   US men,value_us_men
   Global women,value_global_women
   Global men,value_global_men
   ```
   *(Attention: answer in this order)*

   - Replace `value_x` with the calculated growth rates for each group.

**Note on Data Availability:**

- **2024 Data:** As of now, data for the year 2024 may not be available. Please adjust your analysis to include data up to 2023.

      AND `report_year` IN (2014, 2023)
    ORDER BY `report_year`
    LIMIT 2;
    ```

---

**Note:**

These SQL queries are optimized to:

- **Select Only Necessary Columns:** Avoid using `SELECT *` to minimize data scanned.
- **Filter Specific Years:** Use `IN (2014, 2023)` to limit the data to the years of interest.
- **Filter by Workforce:** Ensure that `workforce` is set to `'Overall'` to focus on the overall workforce data.
- **Limit Rows Returned:** Use `LIMIT` to restrict the number of rows returned.

However, if you continue to encounter the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running these queries, it's because your project has exceeded the BigQuery free query bytes scanned quota.

**Possible Solutions:**

- **Enable Billing on Your Project:** Setting up a billing account will allow you to process queries beyond the free tier quota.
- **Wait for Quota Reset:** The free tier quota resets monthly. You can wait until the next billing cycle to run your queries.
- **Use Public Data Sources:** Access publicly available data from [Google's Diversity Annual Reports](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) to manually collect the required information.

**Alternative Approach to Complete Your Task:**

Since adjusting the SQL queries won't resolve the "Quota exceeded" error due to your project exceeding the BigQuery free tier quota, you can perform your analysis using data from publicly available sources.

**Steps to Calculate Growth Rates Manually:**

1. **Collect Data from Reports:**

   - **2014 Data:**
     - Find the percentage of Latinx Googlers in the 2014 Diversity Annual Report.
   - **2023 Data:**
     - Obtain the latest percentage from the 2023 report.

2. **Calculate Growth Rate:**

   Use the growth rate formula:

   \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{5\% - 3\%}{3\%} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2\%}{3\%} \right) \times 100\% \approx 66.67\%
   \]

3. **Compile Your Results in CSV Format:**

   ```csv
   Group,Growth_Rate
   Latinx people,66.67
   ```

   *(Include similar calculations for other demographic groups as per your original task.)*

**Conclusion:**

Due to the quota limitations, further adjustments to the SQL query won't resolve the error. I recommend using the publicly available data to complete your analysis.

     - **Step 1:** Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
     - **Step 2:** Click on **Billing** in the left-hand navigation menu.
     - **Step 3:** Follow the instructions to **link a billing account** to your project or **create a new billing account** if you don't have one.
   
   - **Benefits:**

     - Immediate ability to run your queries.
     - Access to increased quotas and higher performance.
   
   - **Note:** Be mindful of costs. Set up budget alerts and spending limits in the **Billing** section to manage your expenses effectively.

2. **Wait for the Quota to Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** The free tier quota resets at the beginning of each month (UTC time).
   - **Plan Accordingly:** If you can wait until the next billing cycle, you'll be able to run your queries once the quota resets.
   - **Future Planning:** Monitor your query usage to avoid exceeding the quota in the future. You can use BigQuery's **Query Optimizer** and **cost estimation** features to help manage your usage.

3. **Use Publicly Available Data Sources:**

   - **Google Diversity Annual Reports:**

     - **Access Reports:** Visit the [Google Diversity Annual Report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) webpage.
     - **Data Availability:** These reports contain detailed demographic data, including percentages for various groups over the years.
     - **Data Extraction:**

       - **Step 1:** Open the reports for **2014** and the most recent available year (**2023**).
       - **Step 2:** Locate the sections that provide percentages for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, U.S. women, U.S. men, global women, and global men.
       - **Step 3:** Manually extract the percentages for each group for both years.

**Alternative Approach to Complete Your Task:**

Since you cannot run queries due to quota limitations, you can manually collect the required data from the publicly available reports and calculate the growth rates.

**Steps to Calculate Growth Rates Manually:**

1. **Collect Data:**

   - **2014 Data:**

     - **Example:** Let's say the percentage of Latinx Googlers in 2014 was **3%**.

   - **2023 Data:**

     - **Example:** In 2023, the percentage of Latinx Googlers is **8%**.

2. **Calculate Growth Rates:**

   Use the growth rate formula:

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2023} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

   **Example Calculation for Latinx People:**

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{8\% - 3\%}{3\%} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{5\%}{3\%} \right) \times 100\% \approx 166.67\%
   \]

   Repeat this calculation for each demographic group using their respective percentages.

3. **Prepare Your Results in CSV Format:**

   ```csv
   Group,Growth_Rate
   Asians,value_asian
   Black people,value_black
   Latinx people,166.67
   Native Americans,value_native_american
   White people,value_white
   US women,value_us_women
   US men,value_us_men
   Global women,value_global_women
   Global men,value_global_men
   ```
   *(Attention: answer in this order)*

   - Replace `value_x` with the calculated growth rates for each group.
   - Ensure that you calculate and fill in the growth rates for all listed groups.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the quota limitations, adjusting your SQL queries won't resolve the error you're experiencing. The best course of action is to:

- **Option 1:** Enable billing on your project to increase your quota and proceed with running your queries.

- **Option 2:** Use publicly available data from Google's Diversity Annual Reports to manually calculate the growth rates as needed.

2025-01-20 17:59:43 - root - INFO - ```sql
SELECT `report_year`, `race_native_american`

WHERE `workforce` = 'Overall' AND `report_year` IN (2014, 2023)
ORDER BY `report_year`
LIMIT 2;
```

**Explanation:**

The SQL query you've provided is correctly formatted and syntactically valid. It is designed to retrieve the `report_year` and `race_native_american` columns from the `dar_non_intersectional_representation` table in the `google_dei` dataset. The query filters records where:

- **`workforce`** is `'Overall'`.
- **`report_year`** is either **2014** or **2023**.

It orders the results by `report_year` and limits the output to **2** rows.

**Addressing the "Quota Exceeded" Error:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

indicates that your Google Cloud project has exceeded the **BigQuery free query bytes scanned quota**.

**Why This Error Occurs:**

- **Quota Limitations:** BigQuery provides a free tier quota of **1 TB** of data processing per month. Once this limit is exceeded, any further queries that scan data—even minimal amounts—will result in a quota exceeded error.
  
- **Data Scanned vs. Data Returned:** BigQuery charges and enforces quotas based on the amount of data **scanned** during query execution, not on the amount of data **returned** or the complexity of the query.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

   - **Upgrade Your Account:** By setting up a billing account, you can process queries beyond the free tier quota.
   - **How to Enable Billing:**
     - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
     - Navigate to **Billing** and link a billing account to your project.
     - Follow the on-screen instructions to set up billing.
   - **Benefits:**
     - Immediate ability to run your queries.
     - Access to increased quotas and higher limits.
   - **Budget Control:** Set up budget alerts and spending limits in the **Billing** section to manage your expenses effectively.

2. **Wait for the Quota to Reset:**

   - **Monthly Reset:** The free tier quota resets at the beginning of each month (UTC time).
   - **Plan Accordingly:** If you can wait until the next quota cycle, you'll be able to run your queries once the quota resets.
   - **Future Planning:** Monitor your query usage to avoid exceeding the quota in the future.

     - **Data Extraction:**
       - Open the reports for **2014** and **2023**.
       - Locate the sections providing percentages for Native Americans in the overall workforce.
       - Manually extract the data for both years.
     - **Advantages:**
       - No need to run queries against BigQuery, thus avoiding quota issues.
       - Immediate access to the required data.

**Alternative Approach: Calculating Growth Rates Manually**

Given the quota limitations, you can manually collect the required data from the reports and perform your analysis.

**Steps:**

1. **Collect Data:**

   - Find the percentage of Native American Googlers in the overall workforce for 2014 and 2023 from the reports.

2. **Calculate Growth Rate:**

   Use the growth rate formula:

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2023} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

   **Example Calculation:**

   If the percentage in 2014 was **0.5%**, and in 2023 it's **0.8%**:

   \[
   \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{0.8\% - 0.5\%}{0.5\%} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.3\%}{0.5\%} \right) \times 100\% = 60\%
   \]

3. **Prepare Results in CSV Format:**

   ```csv
   Group,Growth_Rate
   Native Americans,60
   ```

   *(Include calculations for other demographic groups as required.)*

---

**Conclusion:**

- **Quota Limitations:** The error is due to your project exceeding the BigQuery free query bytes scanned quota, not because of an error in your SQL syntax.
- **Next Steps:** Consider enabling billing to increase your quota or use publicly available data to complete your analysis.
- **Assistance:** If you need help accessing the reports or performing the calculations, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

2025-01-20 18:00:29 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running your SQL query. The error message indicates that your Google Cloud project has exceeded the BigQuery free query bytes scanned quota:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Why Adjusting the SQL Won't Resolve the Error:**

- **Exceeding the Free Tier:** Since your project has already exceeded the free tier quota, any query that scans data, regardless of how optimized it is, will result in the same error.

- **Minimum Data Scanned:** Even simple queries that select a single column and a few rows will still scan data from the underlying table, triggering the quota limit.
