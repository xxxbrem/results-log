2025-01-20 16:54:48 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a quota error because your query exceeds the free query bytes limit in Google BigQuery. The error message indicates that the amount of data your query is attempting to scan surpasses the available quota for your project.

In BigQuery, the `LIMIT` clause does not reduce the amount of data scanned; it only limits the number of results returned **after** scanning the data. To reduce the data scanned and stay within your quota, you should add a `WHERE` clause to filter the data as early as possible.

Here are some steps to modify your queries to minimize data usage:

1. **Filter by Country Code for Russia:**

   Since you're interested in Russia, you can restrict your query to only fetch records related to Russia (`country_code = 'RUS'`), which will significantly reduce the data scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT country_name, country_code
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
   WHERE country_code = 'RUS';
   ```

2. **Retrieve Debt Indicators for Russia:**

   Focus on the specific debt indicators for Russia to minimize data usage.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT indicator_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
   WHERE country_code = 'RUS';
   ```

3. **Get Top Debt Values for Russia:**

   Limit the query to recent years or a specific year to reduce the amount of data scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT indicator_name, year, value
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
   WHERE country_code = 'RUS' AND year = 2020
   ORDER BY value DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

   This query fetches the top three debt indicators for Russia in 2020 based on the highest debt values.

4. **Check Available Years to Limit Data Further:**

   If you're targeting the most recent data, verify which years have data to narrow down your query.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT year
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
   WHERE country_code = 'RUS'
   ORDER BY year DESC;
   ```

5. **Use Specific Indicator Codes:**

   If you know specific indicator codes related to debt, you can directly query them.

   ```sql
   SELECT indicator_name, value
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
   WHERE country_code = 'RUS' AND indicator_code IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.GN.ZS', 'DT.DOD.DIMF.CD', 'DT.DOD.DLXF.CD')
   ORDER BY value DESC;
   ```

6. **Estimate Query Size Before Execution:**

   In the BigQuery console, you can view an estimate of the data scanned by your query before running it. This helps in adjusting the query to stay within quotas.

**Final Query to Obtain Top Three Debt Indicators for Russia:**

Considering the above, here's a query optimized to retrieve the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values, while minimizing data scanned:

```sql
SELECT indicator_name, value
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE country_code = 'RUS' AND value IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Result:**

Assuming this query executes successfully within your quota, the output would be:

```csv
indicator_name,value
indicator1_name:str,value1:float
indicator2_name:str,value2:float
indicator3_name:str,value3:float
```

These are the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Enable Billing:** If possible, enable billing for your Google Cloud project. This will increase your query quotas significantly.
  
- **Use Data Studio or BI Engine:** Tools like Google Data Studio can sometimes execute queries more efficiently or allow you to visualize data without extensive querying.

- **Aggregate Data:** Instead of fetching detailed records, use aggregate functions to reduce data volume.

   ```sql
   SELECT indicator_name, MAX(value) as max_value
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
   WHERE country_code = 'RUS'
   GROUP BY indicator_name
   ORDER BY max_value DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

**Note:** Always check the estimated data to be scanned before running the query to ensure it stays within your quota limits.

2025-01-20 16:55:21 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering a quota exceeded error when running the query. This happens because BigQuery charges based on the amount of data scanned, not the number of rows returned. Using `LIMIT` does not reduce the data scanned since it applies **after** the data is processed.

To minimize the data scanned and stay within your free quota, you need to filter the data as early as possible in your query, preferably on columns that are indexed or partitioned. Here's how you can proceed:

### Steps to Reduce Data Scanned:

1. **Use Known Country Code for Russia:**

   The country code for Russia is `'RUS'`. Using this code directly in your query will filter the data significantly.

2. **Filter by Specific Year:**

   Limiting the query to a recent year (e.g., `year = 2019`) will further reduce the amount of data scanned.

3. **Modify the Query:**

   Here's an optimized query:

   ```sql
   SELECT indicator_name, value
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
   WHERE country_code = 'RUS' AND year = 2019 AND value IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY value DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

   This query selects only the records for Russia in the year 2019 where the `value` is not null, sorts them in descending order of `value`, and returns the top three results.

4. **Estimate Query Size Before Running:**

   In the BigQuery UI, you can see an estimate of the data that will be scanned. Ensure that this is within your quota before executing the query.

### Final Answer:

Once you run the optimized query, you should get the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values.

```csv
indicator_name,value
indicator_name1:str,value1:float
indicator_name2:str,value2:float
indicator_name3:str,value3:float
```

These indicators represent the highest debt values for Russia in the specified year.

### Example (Hypothetical Data):

Suppose the query returns the following results:

```csv
indicator_name,value
"External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$)", 482000000000.0
"Short-term debt (% of total external debt)", 23.5
"Debt service on external debt, total (TDS, current US$)", 27000000000.0
```

(Note: This data is illustrative. Please run the query to get actual data.)

### Additional Tips:

- **Further Reduce Data Scanned:**

  If you still face quota issues, you can:

  - **Filter by Indicator Codes:** If you know specific indicator codes related to debt, include them in the `WHERE` clause.
  
    ```sql
    WHERE country_code = 'RUS' AND year = 2019 AND indicator_code IN ('DT.DOD.DECT.CD', 'DT.DOD.DSTC.ZS', 'DT.TDS.DECT.CD')
    ```

  - **Limit to Fewer Columns:** Select only the necessary columns.

- **Enable Billing:**

  If possible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to increase your quota.

- **Use the BigQuery Sandbox:**

  The BigQuery sandbox has certain limitations. Ensure you're operating within those constraints.

### Conclusion:

By filtering early in your query, you reduce the amount of data scanned and stay within your quota limits. The optimized query focuses on the necessary data to answer your original question about the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values.

2025-01-20 16:55:53 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 16:55:53 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the quota exceeded error when running your query. The persistent error suggests that your project has exceeded the free query bytes limit provided by Google BigQuery. 

**Understanding the Issue:**

- **BigQuery Quota Limits:** BigQuery provides a limited amount of free data processing per day. Once this limit is exceeded, any additional queries that scan more data will result in a quota error.
  
- **Why `LIMIT` Doesn't Help:** The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows **returned** by the query but doesn't reduce the amount of data **scanned**. BigQuery charges based on the data scanned during query execution.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Wait for Quota Reset:**

   - **Daily Reset:** The free query quota typically resets every 24 hours. You might consider waiting until the quota resets and trying your query again later.

2. **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

   - **Increase Quota Limits:** By enabling billing, you can increase your query quota significantly.
   - **Control Costs:** Set up cost controls or budget alerts to prevent unexpected charges.

3. **Use the BigQuery Sandbox:**

   - **Sandbox Limitations:** If you're using the BigQuery sandbox, it has certain limitations, including a smaller free query quota. You might need to enable billing to run larger queries.

4. **Query a Smaller Dataset:**

   - **Use Sample Data:** If possible, query a smaller sample of the data that fits within your quota.
   - **Filter More Specifically:** Add more restrictive `WHERE` clauses to minimize data scanned.

   For example:

   ```sql
   SELECT indicator_name, value
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
   WHERE country_code = 'RUS'
     AND year = 2019
     AND indicator_name = 'External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$)'
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

   This query targets a specific indicator for a specific year, drastically reducing the amount of data scanned.

5. **Estimate Data Scanned Before Running Queries:**

   - **Use Query Validator:** In the BigQuery UI, before running a query, you can see an estimate of how much data it will scan. This can help you adjust your query to stay within your quota.

6. **Leverage Cached Results:**

   - **Repeated Queries:** BigQuery doesn't charge for queries that return cached results. If you've run the same query before and caching is enabled, you might not incur additional data scanning charges.
   - **Check Cache Settings:** Ensure that your query is eligible for caching by not including non-deterministic functions or data manipulation language (DML) statements.

7. **Explore Alternative Data Sources:**

   - **Use Public Datasets with Lower Data Volume:** If available, find smaller datasets that contain the information you need.
   - **Download Data Locally:** If the dataset is available for download, you could process it locally using tools like SQLite or pandas in Python.

**Assistance with Your Original Task:**

Given the limitations, I can help summarize the process to find the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values:

- **Data Needed:**

  - **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
  - **Columns:** `indicator_name`, `value`, `year`
  - **Filters:**
    - `country_code = 'RUS'`
    - `value IS NOT NULL`
    - Focus on the most recent year available (e.g., `year = 2019` or `year = 2020`)

- **Expected Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT indicator_name, value
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
  WHERE country_code = 'RUS'
    AND year = 2019
    AND value IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY value DESC
  LIMIT 3;
  ```

- **Expected Output Format:**

  ```csv
  indicator_name,value
  indicator_name1:str,value1:float
  indicator_name2:str,value2:float
  indicator_name3:str,value3:float
  ```

**Note:** Since I don't have real-time access to execute queries or retrieve current data, I can't provide the actual values. However, typically, the top debt indicators might include:

- **External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$)**
- **Public and publicly guaranteed debt service (PPG) (current US$)**
- **Total debt service (% of exports of goods, services and primary income)**

These indicators generally reflect the highest debt values for countries.

**Next Steps:**

- **Enable Billing or Wait for Quota Reset:** Consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project or wait until your quota resets to run your queries.
- **Testing Queries with Smaller Data:** Try to run queries that scan less data to see if you can retrieve partial results.
- **Use Google Cloud Free Trial Credits:** If you haven't already, sign up for the Google Cloud free trial, which provides $300 in credits.
