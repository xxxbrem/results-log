After comparing both SQL queries, I conclude that the first SQL query (`0result.sql`) is the correct one. This is because it correctly joins the `geoid` field from the employment data with the `county_fips_code` in the counties data, assuming `county_fips_code` contains the full 5-digit FIPS code. The identifiers align properly, ensuring accurate matching of counties for the percentage increase calculation.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
