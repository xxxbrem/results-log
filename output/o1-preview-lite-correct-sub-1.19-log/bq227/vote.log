The correct SQL query is **`2result.sql`**.

```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Dynamic Selection of Top 5 Categories:** `2result.sql` dynamically identifies the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 by calculating the total crimes per category for that year. This ensures that the analysis is accurate and based on the actual data from 2008.

  ```sql
  WITH top5_categories AS (
    SELECT `minor_category`
    FROM (
      SELECT `minor_category`, SUM(`value`) AS total_crimes
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
      WHERE `year` = 2008
      GROUP BY `minor_category`
      ORDER BY total_crimes DESC
      LIMIT 5
    )
  ),
  ```

- **Calculating Annual Percentage Shares:** The query then calculates the annual total crimes and the total crimes for each of the top 5 categories for each year. It computes the percentage share of each category in the total crimes per year.

  ```sql
  annual_totals AS (
    SELECT `year`, SUM(`value`) AS total_crimes
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
    GROUP BY `year`
  ),
  category_totals AS (
    SELECT `year`, `minor_category`, SUM(`value`) AS category_crimes
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
    WHERE `minor_category` IN (SELECT `minor_category` FROM top5_categories)
    GROUP BY `year`, `minor_category`
  ),
  percentages AS (
    SELECT
      ct.`year`,
      ct.`minor_category`,
      (ct.`category_crimes` / annual.`total_crimes`) * 100 AS percentage_share
    FROM category_totals ct
    JOIN annual_totals annual ON ct.`year` = annual.`year`
  )
  ```

- **Result Formatting:** The final SELECT statement arranges the data so that each year is displayed in one row, with the percentage shares of the top 5 categories rounded to two decimal places.

  ```sql
  SELECT
    p.`year` AS Year,
    ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN p.`minor_category` = 'Other Theft' THEN p.`percentage_share` END), 2) AS `Other Theft`,
    ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN p.`minor_category` = 'Theft From Motor Vehicle' THEN p.`percentage_share` END), 2) AS `Theft From Motor Vehicle`,
    ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN p.`minor_category` = 'Possession Of Drugs' THEN p.`percentage_share` END), 2) AS `Possession Of Drugs`,
    ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN p.`minor_category` = 'Burglary in a Dwelling' THEN p.`percentage_share` END), 2) AS `Burglary in a Dwelling`,
    ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN p.`minor_category` = 'Assault with Injury' THEN p.`percentage_share` END), 2) AS `Assault with Injury`
  FROM percentages p
  GROUP BY p.`year`
  ORDER BY p.`year`;
  ```

**Comparison with Other SQL Queries:**

- **`0result.sql` and `1result.sql`**:

  - Both queries **hardcode the minor categories** based on prior knowledge, assuming that 'Other Theft', 'Theft From Motor Vehicle', 'Possession Of Drugs', 'Burglary in a Dwelling', and 'Assault with Injury' are the top 5 categories from 2008.
  
  - They lack dynamic computation of the top categories from the dataset, which can lead to inaccuracies if the data changes or if the top categories are different.
  
  - Example from `0result.sql`:

    ```sql
    SELECT
      c.`year` AS Year,
      ROUND(100 * c.Minor_category_1 / t.total_crimes, 4) AS `Minor_category_1`,
      -- Other categories...
    ```

- **`2result.sql`**:

  - It **dynamically identifies** the top 5 minor categories from the 2008 data, which makes the analysis robust and adaptable to any changes in the dataset.
  
  - It ensures that the percentage shares are calculated for the correct categories relevant to the 2008 data.

**Conclusion:**

- **`2result.sql`** is the most appropriate and accurate query to fulfill the task requirements because it dynamically selects the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 and calculates their annual percentage shares in London's total crimes for each year, displaying each year in one row with percentages rounded to two decimal places.
