Task: Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Minor_category_1,Minor_category_2,Minor_category_3,Minor_category_4,Minor_category_5
2008,percentage1:float,percentage2:float,percentage3:float,percentage4:float,percentage5:float
2009,percentage1:float,percentage2:float,percentage3:float,percentage4:float,percentage5:float
...
```

This table shows the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes. Each row represents a year, and each column represents one of the top 5 minor crime categories (denoted as `Minor_category_1` to `Minor_category_5`). The `percentage` values are placeholders indicating the share of each category in the total crimes for that year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'london_crime': ['crime_by_lsoa'], 'london_fire_brigade': ['fire_brigade_service_calls']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
