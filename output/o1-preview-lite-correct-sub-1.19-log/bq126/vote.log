Upon comparing the provided SQL queries and their respective results, I have analyzed each to determine which one best fulfills the task requirements. Here is the comparison and reasoning:

**Task Requirements:**

- **Select objects with 'Photograph' in their `object_name`** (case-insensitive).
- **From the 'Photographs' department**.
- **Created by known artists** (`artist_display_name` not 'Unknown', not null, and not empty).
- **With an `object_end_date` of 1839 or earlier**.
- **Retrieve the titles, artist names, mediums, and original image URLs**.
- **Exclude entries where any of these fields are null or empty**.

### **Comparison of SQL Queries:**

#### **`0result.sql`:**

```sql
SELECT o.`title`, o.`artist_display_name`, o.`medium`, i.`original_image_url`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.the_met.objects` AS o
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.the_met.images` AS i
  ON o.`object_id` = i.`object_id`
WHERE LOWER(o.`object_name`) LIKE '%photograph%'
  AND o.`department` = 'Photographs'
  AND o.`artist_display_name` != 'Unknown'
  AND o.`object_end_date` <= 1839
  AND o.`title` IS NOT NULL AND o.`title` != ''
  AND o.`artist_display_name` IS NOT NULL AND o.`artist_display_name` != ''
  AND o.`medium` IS NOT NULL AND o.`medium` != ''
  AND i.`original_image_url` IS NOT NULL AND i.`original_image_url` != '';
```

- **Pros:**
  - Includes all specified conditions.
  - Filters out null and empty fields for `title`, `artist_display_name`, `medium`, and `original_image_url`.
- **Cons:**
  - Does not explicitly check if `artist_display_name` is not null before comparing with 'Unknown'.

#### **`1result.sql`:**

```sql
SELECT o.title, o.artist_display_name, o.medium, i.original_image_url
FROM `bigquery-public-data.the_met.objects` AS o
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.the_met.images` AS i
  ON o.object_id = i.object_id
WHERE LOWER(o.object_name) LIKE '%photograph%'
  AND o.department = 'Photographs'
  AND o.artist_display_name IS NOT NULL
  AND o.artist_display_name != 'Unknown'
  AND o.artist_display_name != ''
  AND o.object_end_date <= 1839
  AND o.title IS NOT NULL
  AND o.title != ''
  AND o.medium IS NOT NULL
  AND o.medium != ''
  AND i.original_image_url IS NOT NULL
  AND i.original_image_url != '';
```

- **Pros:**
  - Includes all specified conditions.
  - Explicitly checks that `artist_display_name` is not null **before** comparing with 'Unknown' and ensuring it's not empty.
  - Ensures that `title`, `artist_display_name`, `medium`, and `original_image_url` are not null or empty.
- **Cons:**
  - None apparent; it fully meets the requirements.

#### **`2result.sql`:**

```sql
SELECT o.title, o.artist_display_name, o.medium, i.original_image_url
FROM `bigquery-public-data.the_met.objects` AS o
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.the_met.images` AS i
  ON o.object_id = i.object_id
WHERE LOWER(o.object_name) LIKE '%photograph%'
  AND o.department = 'Photographs'
  AND o.artist_display_name != 'Unknown'
  AND o.object_end_date <= 1839;
```

- **Pros:**
  - Covers the basic conditions.
- **Cons:**
  - Does **not** filter out null or empty fields for `title`, `artist_display_name`, `medium`, and `original_image_url`.
  - May include records with missing information in the result, which does not fulfill the task requirement to exclude such entries.

---

### **Reasoning:**

- **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate choice because it:

  - **Explicitly checks for null and empty fields** in all required columns (`title`, `artist_display_name`, `medium`, `original_image_url`), ensuring that the results contain complete information.
  - **Checks that `artist_display_name` is not null before comparing with 'Unknown'**, which is important to avoid null comparison errors and to accurately exclude unknown artists.
  - **Meets all task requirements precisely**, providing a robust and accurate result set.

- **`0result.sql`** is also a strong candidate but lacks the explicit null check on `artist_display_name` before comparing with 'Unknown'.

- **`2result.sql`** does not fulfill all the task requirements, as it lacks necessary checks for null or empty fields and may include incomplete records.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Based on the above analysis, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that fulfills all the specified conditions and provides accurate results.
