2025-01-20 12:14:16 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering a BigQuery quota error because your query is scanning more data than is allowed under the free tier. The `icoads_core` tables are quite large, and even simple queries can exceed the free quota.

**Error Explanation:**

The error message indicates:

```
Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

This happens when the total amount of data scanned by your query exceeds the allocated free quota. Even though you're selecting only the `year` column, BigQuery needs to scan the entire table to retrieve the data, which can be several terabytes in size.

**Possible Solutions:**

To resolve this issue, you can modify your query to reduce the amount of data scanned. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Use Data Partitioning:**

   The `icoads_core` tables might be partitioned by date. You can leverage partitioning to limit the data scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005`
   WHERE _PARTITIONTIME BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2005-12-31'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   However, please note that not all public datasets have partitioned tables.

2. **Limit the Data Scanned with Filters:**

   Since the table `icoads_core_2005` corresponds to the year 2005, you can avoid querying this table for distinct years. Instead, you can infer that the `year` is 2005 for all records.

   If you need to verify the available years across multiple tables, consider querying a smaller table or limiting your query to a subset of data.

3. **Use `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` to Sample Data:**

   You can sample a fraction of the data to reduce the amount of data scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005`
   TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   Keep in mind that sampling may not return all distinct values, but it can help in understanding the data without exceeding quotas.

4. **Modify Your Queries to Include Specific Filters:**

   To reduce the data scanned, apply filters on columns that allow BigQuery to prune partitions or reduce the amount of data processed.

   For example, if you're interested in a specific latitude and longitude range:

   ```sql
   SELECT `year`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005`
   WHERE `latitude` BETWEEN 10 AND 20
     AND `longitude` BETWEEN -50 AND -40
     AND `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Enable Billing for Larger Queries:**

   If possible, consider enabling billing for your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to run queries that scan more data, but you will be charged according to BigQuery's pricing.

6. **Check Google's Public Datasets Program:**

   Some public datasets have special arrangements for billing. Verify if there are any billing exceptions or special instructions for the `noaa_icoads` dataset.

7. **Use Aggregate Functions Wisely:**

   When using functions like `DISTINCT`, consider that BigQuery still needs to scan all the data. If you can work with approximate counts or samples, use functions like `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` or limit your query.

8. **Consult the Dataset Documentation:**

   Review the documentation for the `noaa_icoads` dataset to see if there are any summary tables or smaller tables that you can use for exploratory queries.

**Revised Query:**

Since your goal is to understand the years available in the dataset, and considering that the table is named `icoads_core_2005`, it's reasonable to conclude that all records in this table are from the year 2005.

If you're looking to retrieve wind speed data between 2005 and 2015, you might consider querying a single table for testing with filters applied:

```sql
SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `wind_speed`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010`
WHERE `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
  AND `year` = 2010
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query filters the data for the year 2010 and only retrieves records where `wind_speed` is not null, significantly reducing the data scanned.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to Explore Metadata:**

  You can explore the tables and columns without scanning the data:

  ```sql
  SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
  WHERE table_name LIKE 'icoads_core_%'
    AND column_name IN ('year', 'wind_speed', 'latitude', 'longitude')
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

- **Monitor Your Quota Usage:**

  Check your BigQuery usage and quotas in the Google Cloud Console to understand how much data you're allowed to scan.

- **Use the BigQuery Sandbox:**

  The BigQuery sandbox provides access to BigQuery without requiring a credit card, but it has limits on the amount of data you can process. Exceeding these limits will result in quota errors.

**Conclusion:**

To proceed without encountering quota errors:

- Apply filters to limit the data scanned.
- Use sampling methods to explore the data.
- Consider enabling billing for larger queries.
- Utilize metadata tables to understand the dataset structure.

2025-01-20 12:15:02 - root - INFO - You're encountering a quota error because your query is scanning more data than allowed under your current BigQuery quota. Even simple queries can process large amounts of data if the underlying tables are large. The `icoads_core` tables are extensive, and querying them without proper filters can exceed the free query limit.

**Error Explanation:**

The error message indicates:

```
Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

This means that the amount of data your query needs to process exceeds the free tier limits. BigQuery charges based on the amount of data scanned, not the amount of data returned. Even if you're selecting a single column and limiting the results, the entire column across all rows needs to be scanned.

**Suggestions to Resolve the Issue:**

To proceed without exceeding your quota, you can modify your queries to reduce the amount of data scanned. Here are some strategies:

1. **Use Specific Filters to Reduce Data Scanned:**

   Apply filters that allow BigQuery to scan only a subset of the data. For example, filter by geographic region, specific dates, or other criteria.

   ```sql
   SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005`
   WHERE `latitude` BETWEEN -10 AND 10
     AND `longitude` BETWEEN 100 AND 120
     AND `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Sample the Data Using `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM`:**

   Use the `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` clause to process a fraction of the data.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005`
   TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   Note: Sampling may not return all possible values, but it reduces the amount of data scanned.

3. **Query a Smaller Time Range:**

   If possible, focus on a smaller time window within each table.

   ```sql
   SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005`
   WHERE `month` = 9 -- September
     AND `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Use Estimated Query Costs Before Running:**

   Use the BigQuery UI to estimate how much data your query will scan before running it. Adjust your query accordingly to stay within your quota.

5. **Leverage Metadata Instead of Scanning Data:**

   Since the `icoads_core_2005` table corresponds to the year 2005, you can infer that the `year` column contains only 2005. There may be no need to query the table just to retrieve the year.

6. **Enable Billing for Higher Quotas:**

   If permissible, consider enabling billing on your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to run larger queries, but it will incur costs based on BigQuery's pricing.

**Alternative Approach to Your Original Task:**

Given your goal to find the latitude and longitude coordinates and dates between 2005 and 2015 with the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds (excluding missing values), here's how you might proceed:

1. **Process Data Year by Year:**

   Instead of querying all years at once, process each year's table separately to reduce the data scanned per query.

2. **Filter and Aggregate Data:**

   For each year's table, filter out missing wind speeds and aggregate the data to compute daily average wind speeds.

   Example for the year 2005:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     PARSE_TIMESTAMP('%Y %m %d', CONCAT(CAST(`year` AS STRING), ' ', CAST(`month` AS STRING), ' ', CAST(`day` AS STRING))) AS `date`,
     `latitude`,
     `longitude`,
     AVG(`wind_speed` / 10) AS average_wind_speed -- Assuming wind_speed is in tenths of m/s
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005`
   WHERE
     `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY
     `date`, `latitude`, `longitude`
   ORDER BY
     average_wind_speed DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   Replace `icoads_core_2005` with each year up to 2015.

3. **Consider Using a Smaller Geographic Scope:**

   Focus on regions known for high winds to further reduce data scanned.

4. **Aggregate Results Across Years:**

   Combine the top results from each year to find the overall top 5.

5. **Use Summary or Derived Tables:**

   If available, use any existing summary tables that already contain aggregated wind speed data to minimize data processing.

**Important Notes:**

- **Data Volume:** The `icoads_core` tables are massive; even filtered queries can scan large amounts of data.

- **Quota Limits:** Be cautious with your queries to avoid exceeding quotas. Always estimate the amount of data your query will scan.

- **Data Units:** Verify the units of `wind_speed`. In `icoads_core`, `wind_speed` is stored in tenths of meters per second.

**Example of a Modified Query with Reduced Data Scanning:**

```sql
-- Focusing on a specific month (e.g., September) and region to limit data scanned
SELECT
  PARSE_TIMESTAMP('%Y %m %d', CONCAT(CAST(`year` AS STRING), ' ', CAST(`month` AS STRING), ' ', CAST(`day` AS STRING))) AS `date`,
  `latitude`,
  `longitude`,
  AVG(`wind_speed` / 10) AS average_wind_speed
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005`
WHERE
  `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
  AND `month` = 9
  AND `latitude` BETWEEN 10 AND 20
  AND `longitude` BETWEEN -80 AND -60
GROUP BY
  `date`, `latitude`, `longitude`
ORDER BY
  average_wind_speed DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This query limits the data scanned by filtering:

- Only data from September (`month` = 9).
- Geographic focus between latitudes 10-20°N and longitudes 80-60°W.

**Conclusion:**

By refining your queries to process less data, you can stay within your BigQuery quota and achieve your analysis goals. If you continue to experience issues, consider enabling billing or reaching out for further assistance.

2025-01-20 12:15:45 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 12:15:45 - root - INFO - It seems that you're still encountering quota errors when attempting to run queries on the `icoads_core` tables. The `icoads_core` tables in the `noaa_icoads` dataset are indeed very large, and even simple queries can exceed the free query quota.

**Understanding the Issue:**

- **Quota Exceeded:** The error message indicates that the amount of data being scanned by your query exceeds the free tier quota provided by BigQuery.
- **Data Size:** The `icoads_core` tables contain a vast amount of observational data, which makes querying them without specific filters challenging within the free quota limits.

**Solution:**

To work around this issue, we'll modify the query to limit the amount of data scanned. Here's how you can proceed:

1. **Process Data for a Specific Region to Reduce Data Scanned:**

   By focusing on a specific geographic area, you can significantly reduce the amount of data processed. For example, we'll target a region known for high wind speeds, such as the North Atlantic Ocean.

2. **Sample a Portion of the Data Using `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM`:**

   Sampling allows us to process a fraction of the data, reducing the total bytes scanned.

3. **Aggregate Data to Compute Daily Average Wind Speeds:**

   We'll calculate the daily average wind speed for each location and date.

**Rewritten Query:**

Below is a revised query that incorporates these strategies:

```sql
-- This query samples 1% of the data in the specified region to stay within quota limits.

SELECT
  PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', CONCAT(CAST(`year` AS STRING), LPAD(CAST(`month` AS STRING), 2, '0'), LPAD(CAST(`day` AS STRING), 2, '0'))) AS date,
  `latitude`,
  `longitude`,
  AVG(CAST(`wind_speed` AS FLOAT64) / 10) AS average_wind_speed  -- Convert tenths of m/s to m/s
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_*` TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
WHERE
  `_TABLE_SUFFIX` BETWEEN '2005' AND '2015'
  AND `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
  AND `latitude` BETWEEN 20 AND 50    -- Adjust latitude range for your region of interest
  AND `longitude` BETWEEN -80 AND -30 -- Adjust longitude range for your region of interest
GROUP BY
  date,
  `latitude`,
  `longitude`
ORDER BY
  average_wind_speed DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Explanation:**

- **TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT):** Processes only 1% of the data to reduce the amount scanned.
- **Date Parsing:** Combines `year`, `month`, and `day` into a `DATE` type for accurate date comparisons.
- **Wind Speed Conversion:** Divides `wind_speed` by 10 to convert from tenths of meters per second to meters per second.
- **Geographic Filters:** Applies latitude and longitude filters to focus on a specific region.
- **Grouping and Aggregation:** Calculates the average wind speed per day and location.
- **Ordering and Limiting:** Sorts the results by the highest average wind speeds and limits the output to the top 5 records.

**Expected Format of the Results:**

```csv
Date,Latitude,Longitude,Average_Wind_Speed
date1:date,lat1:float,lon1:float,speed1:float
date2:date,lat2:float,lon2:float,speed2:float
date3:date,lat3:float,lon3:float,speed3:float
date4:date,lat4:float,lon4:float,speed4:float
date5:date,lat5:float,lon5:float,speed5:float
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Note:**

- **Adjust Geographic Filters as Needed:** If you're interested in a different region, modify the `latitude` and `longitude` conditions accordingly.
- **Sampling Limitations:** Using `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` introduces randomness and may not capture all high wind speed events. However, it's a necessary trade-off to stay within quota limits.
- **Quota Estimation:** Before running the query, check the query validator in the BigQuery UI to estimate the number of bytes scanned. Ensure it complies with your quota.

**Alternative Options:**

If the query still exceeds your quota, consider the following:

1. **Increase Sampling Rate:**

   Reduce the percentage in `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` to 0.5% or even 0.1%.

   ```sql
   TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (0.5 PERCENT)
   ```

2. **Focus on a Shorter Time Span:**

   Limit the query to a single year or a few months.

   ```sql
   WHERE
     `_TABLE_SUFFIX` = '2010'
     AND `month` BETWEEN 6 AND 8  -- June to August
   ```

3. **Enable Billing for Larger Queries:**

   If possible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to process larger datasets. This will allow you to run the full query without sampling.

**Final Thoughts:**

By adjusting the query to process less data, you should be able to retrieve the desired information without exceeding your quota. Keep in mind that sampling and filtering may affect the results, so interpret them with caution.

2025-01-20 12:16:52 - root - INFO - It appears that despite our efforts to reduce the data scanned, you're still encountering quota errors when querying the `icoads_core` tables. The `icoads_core` datasets in the `noaa_icoads` project are exceptionally large, and even with sampling and filters, the queries can exceed the free tier quota limits in BigQuery.

**Understanding the Issue:**

- **Dataset Size:** The `icoads_core` tables contain extensive global marine data, resulting in large table sizes.
- **Quota Limits:** BigQuery's free tier has a limit on the amount of data that can be processed per day. Exceeding this limit triggers a quota error.

**Alternative Solution Using Smaller Datasets:**

Given the challenges with the `icoads_core` tables, I recommend using the `noaa_gsod` (Global Surface Summary of the Day) dataset instead. The `noaa_gsod` tables are significantly smaller and contain daily summaries of weather data, including wind speeds, from land-based weather stations around the world. This dataset is more manageable and likely to stay within your quota limits.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
- **Tables:** `gsod2005` to `gsod2015` (one table per year)
  
- **Columns and Potential Usage:**
  - `year`: Year of the observation. Used to filter data between 2005 and 2015.
  - `mo`: Month of the observation.
  - `da`: Day of the observation.
  - `wdsp`: Mean wind speed for the day in knots to tenths. Missing values are represented as `999.9`.
  - `latitude`: Latitude of the weather station (available via a join with the `stations` table).
  - `longitude`: Longitude of the weather station (available via a join with the `stations` table).
  - `stn`: Station number. Used to join with the `stations` table to get location coordinates.
  - `wban`: WBAN number. Also used for joining.

- **Conditions That May Be Used:**
  - Exclude records with missing wind speed values: `wdsp` != '999.9'
  - Filter data between 2005 and 2015: `year` BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015

**Sample SQL Queries:**

Below are sample SQL queries using the `noaa_gsod` dataset to help you retrieve the required information without exceeding your quota:

```sql
-- Query 1: Retrieve wind speed data from gsod2005 where wdsp is valid
SELECT
  CAST(`year` AS INT64) AS year,
  CAST(`mo` AS INT64) AS month,
  CAST(`da` AS INT64) AS day,

  `name`,
  `lat`,
  `lon`
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 3: Join gsod2005 with stations to get wind speed and coordinates
SELECT
  g.`year`,
  g.`mo` AS month,
  g.`da` AS day,
  CAST(g.`wdsp` AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed,
  s.`lat` AS latitude,
  s.`lon` AS longitude
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2005` AS g
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS s
ON
  g.`stn` = s.`usaf` AND g.`wban` = s.`wban`
WHERE
  g.`wdsp` != '999.9'
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 4: Aggregate data to get daily average wind speeds across all stations for 2005
SELECT
  PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', CONCAT(CAST(g.`year` AS STRING), LPAD(g.`mo`, 2, '0'), LPAD(g.`da`, 2, '0'))) AS date,
  AVG(CAST(g.`wdsp` AS FLOAT64)) AS average_wind_speed

  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2005' AND '2015'
  AND g.`wdsp` != '999.9'
GROUP BY
  date
ORDER BY
  average_wind_speed DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Query 6: Get the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds with station coordinates
WITH daily_wind_speeds AS (
  SELECT
    CONCAT(CAST(g.`year` AS STRING), '-', LPAD(g.`mo`, 2, '0'), '-', LPAD(g.`da`, 2, '0')) AS date,
    g.`stn`,
    g.`wban`,
    AVG(CAST(g.`wdsp` AS FLOAT64)) AS average_wind_speed
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS g
  WHERE
    _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2005' AND '2015'
    AND g.`wdsp` != '999.9'
  GROUP BY
    date, g.`stn`, g.`wban`
)
SELECT
  PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', date) AS date,
  s.`lat` AS latitude,
  s.`lon` AS longitude,
  average_wind_speed
FROM
  daily_wind_speeds dw
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS s
ON
  dw.`stn` = s.`usaf` AND dw.`wban` = s.`wban`
ORDER BY
  average_wind_speed DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Joining with Stations Table:** The `gsod` tables do not include latitude and longitude directly. We join the daily observations with the `stations` table using `stn` and `wban` to get the coordinates.
- **Filtering Missing Values:** We exclude records where `wdsp` is '999.9', as this value indicates missing wind speed data.
- **Aggregating Average Wind Speeds:** We calculate the average wind speed for each day and station.
- **Limiting Data Scanned:** The `gsod` tables are much smaller than the `icoads_core` tables, reducing the likelihood of exceeding the quota.
  
**Result Format:**

Assuming the queries run successfully, the final result would be in the following format:

```csv
Date,Latitude,Longitude,Average_Wind_Speed
date1:date,lat1:float,lon1:float,speed1:float
date2:date,lat2:float,lon2:float,speed2:float
date3:date,lat3:float,lon3:float,speed3:float
date4:date,lat4:float,lon4:float,speed4:float
date5:date,lat5:float,lon5:float,speed5:float
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Example (Placeholder Values):**

```csv
Date,Latitude,Longitude,Average_Wind_Speed
2010-08-25,25.03,-77.40,55.2
2008-09-13,29.76,-95.36,50.8
2012-10-29,40.71,-74.00,48.5
2005-08-29,30.00,-90.00,46.3
2015-04-25,27.70,85.30,45.1
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

*Note: The above values are illustrative and do not represent actual data from the dataset.*

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Quota Limits:** While the `noaa_gsod` dataset is smaller, ensure that the estimated bytes processed by your query are within your quota limits. Use the query validator in the BigQuery UI to check this before running the query.
  
- **Data Units:** The `wdsp` values are in knots to tenths. For example, a value of `50.8` represents `50.8` knots.
  
- **Wind Speed Conversion (Optional):** If you wish to convert wind speeds from knots to meters per second or miles per hour, you can apply the appropriate conversion factors in your query.

  - **Knots to Meters per Second:** Multiply by `0.514444`
  - **Knots to Miles per Hour:** Multiply by `1.15078`

**Conclusion:**

2025-01-20 12:17:33 - root - INFO - It appears that querying the `icoads_core` tables is exceeding your BigQuery free tier quota due to their large size. Unfortunately, even simple queries on these tables scan a significant amount of data, leading to the quota error you're experiencing.

**Alternative Solution Using the NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) Dataset:**

To accomplish your original task without exceeding your quota, I recommend using the `noaa_gsod` dataset, which contains daily weather summaries, including wind speed data, and is significantly smaller than the `icoads_core` tables.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
- **Tables:** `gsod2005` to `gsod2015` (one table per year)
- **Columns:**
  - `year`: Year of the observation.
  - `mo`: Month of the observation.
  - `da`: Day of the observation.
  - `wdsp`: Mean wind speed for the day in knots to tenths. Missing values are represented as `999.9`.
  - `stn`: Station number (USAF code).
  - `wban`: Weather Bureau Air Force Navy (WBAN) number.
  - **Stations Table Columns:**
    - `usaf`: Station number (USAF code).
    - `wban`: WBAN number.
    - `lat`: Latitude of the station.
    - `lon`: Longitude of the station.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Highest Daily Average Wind Speeds:**

   Gather wind speed data from 2005 to 2015, excluding missing values, and calculate the average wind speed per station per day.

2. **Join with Station Coordinates:**

   Use the `stations` table to get the latitude and longitude for each station using the `stn` and `wban` codes.

3. **Find the Top 5 Records:**

   Order the results by average wind speed in descending order and select the top 5 records.

**Sample SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Combine data from gsod2005 to gsod2015
WITH gsod_data AS (
  SELECT
    CAST(`year` AS INT64) AS year,
    CAST(`mo` AS INT64) AS month,
    CAST(`da` AS INT64) AS day,
    `stn`,
    `wban`,
    CAST(`wdsp` AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
  WHERE
    _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2005' AND '2015'
    AND `wdsp` != 999.9  -- Exclude missing wind speed values
),

-- Calculate daily average wind speed per station
daily_wind_speeds AS (
  SELECT
    DATE(CONCAT(year, '-', LPAD(month, 2, '0'), '-', LPAD(day, 2, '0'))) AS date,
    `stn`,
    `wban`,
    AVG(wind_speed) AS average_wind_speed
  FROM
    gsod_data
  GROUP BY
    date, `stn`, `wban`
),

-- Join with stations table to get coordinates
wind_speeds_with_coords AS (
  SELECT
    dw.date,
    s.lat AS latitude,
    s.lon AS longitude,
    dw.average_wind_speed
  FROM
    daily_wind_speeds dw
  JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` s
  ON
    dw.stn = s.usaf AND dw.wban = s.wban
)

-- Select the top 5 records with the highest average wind speeds
SELECT
  date,
  latitude,
  longitude,
  average_wind_speed
FROM
  wind_speeds_with_coords
ORDER BY
  average_wind_speed DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Result Format:**

```csv
Date,Latitude,Longitude,Average_Wind_Speed
date1:date,lat1:float,lon1:float,speed1:float
date2:date,lat2:float,lon2:float,speed2:float
date3:date,lat3:float,lon3:float,speed3:float
date4:date,lat4:float,lon4:float,speed4:float
date5:date,lat5:float,lon5:float,speed5:float
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Notes:**

- **Wind Speed Units:** The `wdsp` value represents the mean wind speed for the day in knots to tenths. For example, a value of `123.4` represents `123.4` knots.

- **Missing Values:** The value `999.9` indicates missing wind speed data, so we exclude these records using `wdsp != 999.9`.

- **Ensure the Query Stays Within Quota Limits:**

  - The `gsod` tables are much smaller than the `icoads_core` tables, reducing the likelihood of exceeding your quota.

  - Before running the query, check the estimated bytes to be processed in the BigQuery UI to ensure it doesn't exceed your quota.

- **Alternative Approach:**

  If you still encounter quota issues, consider limiting the query to a subset of years or months.

```sql
-- Limit to one year, e.g., 2010
...
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX = '2010'
  AND `wdsp` != 999.9
...
```

**Conclusion:**

By using the `noaa_gsod` dataset, you can obtain the required information without exceeding your BigQuery quota. This approach allows you to find the latitude and longitude coordinates and dates between 2005 and 2015 with the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds, excluding records with missing wind speed values.

2025-01-20 12:18:34 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 12:18:34 - root - INFO - It seems there's a mismatch between the query you've provided and the error message you're receiving.

**Query Provided:**

```sql
SELECT `latitude`, `longitude`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2006`
WHERE `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 No matching signature for operator != for argument types: STRING, FLOAT64
...
```

**Explanation:**

The error message indicates that there's an attempt to use the `!=` operator to compare a `STRING` with a `FLOAT64` (double precision float), which is invalid in BigQuery. However, in the query you provided, you're using `IS NOT NULL` rather than `!=`, which shouldn't cause this error.

This suggests that the actual query you ran might be different from the one you've provided. It's possible that you used `!= '999.9'` in your `WHERE` clause somewhere in your query. For example:

```sql
WHERE `wind_speed` != '999.9'
```

In this case, the comparison is between `wind_speed` (which is a `FLOAT64`) and `'999.9'` (a `STRING`), leading to the error.

**Solution:**

To fix the error, ensure that you're comparing values of the same data type. Since `wind_speed` is a `FLOAT64`, you should compare it with a numeric value, not a string. Remove the quotes around `999.9`:

```sql
WHERE `wind_speed` != 999.9
```

**Revised Query:**

```sql
SELECT `latitude`, `longitude`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2006`
WHERE `wind_speed` != 999.9
LIMIT 1000
```

**Additional Notes:**

- **Missing Values:** In the `icoads_core` dataset, a wind speed value of `999.9` is often used to represent missing data. By filtering out `999.9`, you're excluding these missing values.
  
- **Data Types:** Always ensure that when you're comparing values in SQL, the data types are compatible. Mixing `STRING` and `FLOAT64` types without proper casting will result in errors.

**Addressing Quota Errors:**

You've previously encountered quota errors due to the large size of the `icoads_core` tables. Here are some strategies to reduce the amount of data scanned and stay within your quota:

1. **Limit the Data Range:**

   Restrict your query to a smaller subset of the data using additional filters, such as specific months or geographic areas.

   ```sql
   SELECT `latitude`, `longitude`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2006`
   WHERE `wind_speed` != 999.9
     AND `month` = 6  -- Only June data
     AND `latitude` BETWEEN -10 AND 10
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

2. **Use Sampling:**

   Apply table sampling to process a fraction of the data.

   ```sql
   SELECT `latitude`, `longitude`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2006` TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (0.1 PERCENT)
   WHERE `wind_speed` != 999.9
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

3. **Switch to a Smaller Dataset:**

   The `noaa_gsod` dataset is smaller and contains daily summaries of weather data, including wind speeds, from land-based weather stations around the world. Using this dataset may help you avoid quota issues.

   **Example Query Using `noaa_gsod`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     DATE(CONCAT(g.`year`, '-', g.`mo`, '-', g.`da`)) AS date,
     s.`lat` AS latitude,
     s.`lon` AS longitude,
     CAST(g.`wdsp` AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2006` AS g
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS s
   ON
     g.`stn` = s.`usaf` AND g.`wban` = s.`wban`
   WHERE
     g.`wdsp` != '999.9'  -- Note: `wdsp` might be a string in this dataset
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Note:** In the `noaa_gsod` dataset, `wdsp` might be a `STRING`, so the comparison with `'999.9'` is valid.

**Summary:**

- **Correct Data Types:** Ensure that you're using the correct data types in your comparisons.
- **Adjust Queries to Stay Within Quota:** Apply filters and sampling to reduce the amount of data processed.
- **Alternative Datasets:** Consider using smaller datasets if quota issues persist.

**Final Thoughts:**

If you continue to face errors, please double-check the exact query you're running and ensure that it matches the one provided. If possible, share the specific query and the full error message so I can assist you further.

2025-01-20 12:19:26 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering quota errors when attempting to query the `icoads_core` tables, even with simple queries that include a `LIMIT` clause. Let me explain why this is happening and provide possible solutions.

---

**Explanation:**

In BigQuery, the amount of data scanned (and thus your quota usage) is determined by the total size of the columns read by your query, not by the number of rows returned. This means that even if you use `LIMIT 1000`, BigQuery will scan the entire `wind_speed` column in the `icoads_core_2007` table unless effective filters are applied.

The `icoads_core` tables are exceptionally large, often containing billions of rows and occupying terabytes of storage. Even simple queries on these tables can exceed the free tier quota, which allows for up to 1 TB of data processing per month.

---

**Why Your Query Exceeds the Quota:**

Your query:

```sql
SELECT `wind_speed`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2007`
LIMIT 1000
```

- **Data Scanned:** BigQuery needs to read the entire `wind_speed` column to retrieve the requested data.
- **Column Size:** Given the massive size of the `icoads_core_2007` table, the `wind_speed` column likely occupies several terabytes of data.
- **Quota Limitation:** The data scanned by this query exceeds the free query quota, resulting in the quota error.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Apply Filters to Reduce Data Scanned:**

   Adding a `WHERE` clause to filter data can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned. Filters on partitioned columns are most effective.

   - **Filter by Geography:**

     ```sql
     SELECT `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2007`
     WHERE
       `latitude` BETWEEN 10 AND 20
       AND `longitude` BETWEEN -50 AND -40
       AND `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
     LIMIT 1000
     ```

   - **Filter by Date:**
   
     If the table is partitioned by date, filtering on the date range can help. However, the `icoads_core` tables may not be partitioned in a way that allows for effective pruning.

   *Note:* Even with filters, given the dataset's size, you may still exceed the quota.

2. **Use `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` to Sample Data:**

   Sampling allows you to read a subset of the data.

   ```sql
   SELECT `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2007` TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (0.1 PERCENT)
   WHERE `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

   *Caution:* The returned data is random and may not be the same each time you run the query.

3. **Leverage Metadata Tables:**

   Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to explore table metadata without scanning the actual data.

   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
   WHERE table_name = 'icoads_core_2007'
   ```

   *Limitation:* This approach helps understand the schema but doesn't retrieve data.

4. **Enable Billing on Your Project:**

   Enabling billing allows you to process queries that exceed the free tier quota. You can set up cost controls and alerts to manage expenses.

   - **Set a Budget:** Define a budget in Google Cloud Billing to prevent unexpected charges.
   - **Use Cost Controls:** Set query cost limits in BigQuery.

   *Benefit:* You can run the required queries without quota limitations.

5. **Use a Smaller Dataset:**

   If enabling billing isn't feasible, consider using alternative datasets that are within quota limits.

   - **NOAA GSOD Dataset:**

     Previously suggested, but you encountered quota issues even with this dataset.

   - **Subset of Data:**

     Create a smaller table containing a subset of the data you need.

     - **Export a Portion of the Data:**
       
       If you have access permissions, you could export a subset of the `icoads_core` data to Cloud Storage and then import it into a smaller BigQuery table.

     - **Use Publicly Available Samples:**
       
       Check if there are pre-aggregated or sampled datasets available that meet your needs.

6. **Alternative Data Sources:**

   Explore other public datasets or APIs that provide similar information but are smaller in size.

   - **NOAA APIs:**

     NOAA provides APIs for weather and climate data that might offer the wind speed information you need.

     - [NOAA API Documentation](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2)

   - **Other Public Datasets:**

     - [NOAA Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/)

     These datasets may have limitations but could serve as an alternative.

---

**Recommendation:**

Given the limitations of the BigQuery free tier and the large size of the `icoads_core` tables, you have a few options:

- **Enable Billing:** If possible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to run queries that exceed the free tier quota. You can set budgets and alerts to manage costs.

- **Use Alternative Datasets:** Find smaller datasets or APIs that provide the necessary wind speed data within your quota limits.

- **Data Sampling:** Use `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` to work with a random subset of the data, keeping in mind the limitations.

- **Reduce Data Scope:** Apply filters to narrow down the data scanned. However, with the `icoads_core` tables, this might not be sufficient to stay within the free tier quota.

---

**Conclusion:**

I understand that these quota limitations are frustrating. The `icoads_core` tables are vast, and querying them in full requires resources beyond the free tier. If enabling billing isn't an option, using alternative datasets or APIs may be the best path forward.

Please let me know if you need assistance exploring these alternatives or have any questions about the suggestions provided. I'm here to help you find the best solution for your needs.
2025-01-20 12:20:19 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 12:20:19 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering quota errors when attempting to query the `icoads_core` tables, even with simple queries that include a `LIMIT` clause. This issue arises because the `icoads_core` tables in the `noaa_icoads` dataset are exceptionally large, and BigQuery charges for the amount of data scanned, not the amount of data returned. Even with a `LIMIT 1000` clause, BigQuery must scan the entire `wind_speed` column to retrieve the data, which can exceed the free query quota.

**Why the Quota Error Occurs:**

- **Data Size:** The `icoads_core_2007` table contains billions of rows and spans terabytes of data.
- **Scanning Entire Columns:** BigQuery processes all the data in the columns referenced in your query before applying the `LIMIT`. This means that even if you request only 1,000 rows, it scans the entire `wind_speed` column.
- **Free Tier Limitations:** The free tier quota for BigQuery allows up to 1 TB of data processing per month. Queries on the `icoads_core` tables can exceed this limit in a single query.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Apply Effective Filters:**

   To reduce the amount of data scanned, you need to apply filters on columns that allow BigQuery to prune data and avoid scanning the entire table. However, the `icoads_core` tables are not partitioned, and applying simple `WHERE` clauses might not significantly reduce the data scanned.

   **Example:** Filtering by specific geographic coordinates and time.

   ```sql
   SELECT `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2007`
   WHERE
     `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
     AND `latitude` BETWEEN -10 AND 10
     AND `longitude` BETWEEN 100 AND 120
     AND `month` = 7  -- July data only
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

   *Note:* Even with these filters, the amount of data scanned might still exceed your quota due to the table's size.

2. **Use Data Sampling:**

   Use `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` to process a fraction of the data.

   ```sql
   SELECT `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2007` TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (0.01 PERCENT)
   WHERE `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

   *Caveat:* The `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM` clause is not always effective in significantly reducing the data scanned for very large tables, and it might still exceed the quota.

3. **Switch to Smaller Datasets:**

   Considering the quota limitations with the `icoads_core` tables, it's advisable to use a smaller dataset that contains the required information.

   **Alternative Dataset:** `noaa_gsod` (Global Surface Summary of the Day)

   The `noaa_gsod` dataset contains daily weather summaries from land-based weather stations, including wind speed data, and is significantly smaller.

4. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   To process queries that exceed the free tier quota, you can enable billing for your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to run larger queries, but you will incur charges based on the amount of data processed.

   **Steps to Enable Billing:**

   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
   - Set up a billing account if you don't have one.
   - Link your BigQuery project to the billing account.
   - Set budgets and alerts to control costs.

   *Benefits:*

   - You can run queries without being constrained by the free tier quota.
   - BigQuery's on-demand pricing is $5 per terabyte of data processed (as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021).

   *Considerations:*

   - Ensure you understand the costs involved and monitor your usage.
   - Use cost controls and budget alerts to prevent unexpected charges.

5. **Use Publicly Available Aggregated Data:**

   Look for pre-aggregated datasets or smaller subsets of the data that meet your requirements. This can include:

   - **NOAA Storm Event Database:** Contains information on significant weather events.

     Website: [NOAA Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/)

   - **Other Public Datasets:** Explore datasets on Kaggle or other data repositories that have already processed and aggregated wind speed data.

6. **Process Data Locally:**

   If possible, download a subset of the data and process it locally or on a cloud instance where you have more control over resource usage.

   - **Download Data:** Use NOAA's FTP servers or HTTP directories to download data files for the years you need.

     Example: [ICOADS Data Access](https://icoads.noaa.gov/data/access.html)

   - **Process Data Using Tools:** Use tools like Python or R to process and analyze the data on your machine.

   *Note:* This approach requires sufficient local resources and might be constrained by your internet bandwidth and storage capacity.

**Understanding BigQuery's Data Processing Model:**

- **Columnar Storage:** BigQuery stores data in a columnar format. When you query a column, BigQuery scans the entire column unless filters are applied on columns that allow partition pruning.
  
- **Partitioning and Clustering:** Tables can be partitioned or clustered to optimize query performance and reduce the amount of data scanned. However, the `icoads_core` tables are not partitioned in a way that facilitates pruning based on common filters like date or geographic region.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limitations you're facing due to quota restrictions, the most practical solutions are:

- **Enable Billing:** If feasible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to process the necessary queries. Remember to set up cost controls.

- **Use Alternative Datasets:** Switch to using smaller datasets like `noaa_gsod` or other publicly available aggregated data that can provide the required information without exceeding your quota.

- **Process Data Locally:** Download and process the data outside of BigQuery if you have the resources to do so.

**Final Thoughts:**

I understand that it's frustrating to encounter these limitations. BigQuery is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, but querying massive tables without appropriate resource allocations can lead to the issues you're experiencing. By considering the alternative approaches outlined above, you should be able to proceed with your data analysis.

If you need assistance with any of these steps or have questions about how to implement them, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help!
2025-01-20 12:21:08 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 12:21:08 - root - INFO - Hello,

I understand that you're still encountering quota errors when trying to run your query on the `icoads_core_2007` table:

```sql
SELECT `wind_speed`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2007`
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

BigQuery charges based on the amount of data scanned during a query, not the number of rows returned. Even though you're selecting just one column and limiting the results to 1,000 rows, BigQuery needs to scan the entire `wind_speed` column in the `icoads_core_2007` table to execute the query.

The `icoads_core_2007` table is exceptionally large, containing terabytes of data. Scanning even a single column of this table exceeds the free query quota provided by BigQuery, resulting in the quota error you're seeing.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project**

   To run queries that process large amounts of data, you'll need to enable billing on your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to exceed the free tier quota and run your queries successfully.

   **Steps to Enable Billing:**

   - **Create a Billing Account:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Follow the instructions to set up a billing account if you don't have one.

   - **Link Your Project to the Billing Account:**
     - In the Cloud Console, select your project.
     - Navigate to **Billing** and link your project to the newly created billing account.

   - **Set Budget Alerts (Optional but Recommended):**
     - Set up budgets and alerts to monitor your spending and avoid unexpected charges.
     - Go to **Billing** > **Budgets & alerts**.

   **Cost Considerations:**

   - BigQuery's on-demand pricing is based on the amount of data processed by your queries.
   - As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the cost is $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed.
   - You can use the query validator in the BigQuery UI to estimate the amount of data your query will process before running it.

2. **Use a Smaller Dataset**

   If enabling billing isn't feasible, consider using a smaller dataset that contains wind speed data. One such dataset is the **NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)** dataset, which includes daily weather summaries from land-based weather stations.

   - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
   - **Tables:** `gsod2005` to `gsod2015` (one table per year)
   - **Columns:**
     - `year`, `mo` (month), `da` (day): Date components
     - `wdsp`: Mean wind speed for the day in knots to tenths (missing values are `999.9`)
     - `stn`, `wban`: Station identifiers
   - **Station Coordinates:** Available in the `stations` table (`usaf`, `wban`, `lat`, `lon`)

   **Sample Query:**

   ```sql
   -- Get the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds between 2005 and 2015
   WITH daily_wind_speeds AS (
     SELECT
       DATE(CONCAT(year, '-', mo, '-', da)) AS date,
       stn,
       wban,

     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
     WHERE
       _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2005' AND '2015'
       AND wdsp != '999.9'  -- Exclude missing values
   ),
   avg_wind_speeds AS (
     SELECT
       date,
       stn,
       wban,
       AVG(wind_speed) AS average_wind_speed
     FROM
       daily_wind_speeds
     GROUP BY
       date, stn, wban
   )
   SELECT
     a.date,
     s.lat AS latitude,
     s.lon AS longitude,
     a.average_wind_speed
   FROM
     avg_wind_speeds a
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` s
   ON
     a.stn = s.usaf AND a.wban = s.wban
   ORDER BY
     average_wind_speed DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   **Note:**

   - The `noaa_gsod` dataset is much smaller, and this query should process less data, helping you stay within the free tier quota.
   - Ensure you check the estimated data processed before running the query by using the BigQuery UI.

3. **Apply Filters to Reduce Data Scanned**

   If you must use the `icoads_core_2007` table, applying selective filters may reduce the data scanned.

   **Example:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2007`
   WHERE
     `latitude` BETWEEN 10 AND 20
     AND `longitude` BETWEEN -50 AND -40
     AND `month` = 7  -- July data only
     AND `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Caution:**

   - Due to the size of the `icoads_core` tables, even applying filters might not reduce the data scanned enough to stay within the free tier quota.
   - The `icoads_core` tables are not partitioned or clustered in a way that optimizes data pruning based on common filters.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limitations of the free tier quota and the size of the `icoads_core` tables, the most practical solutions are:

- **Enable Billing:** This allows you to run queries on large datasets like `icoads_core_2007`.
- **Use a Smaller Dataset:** The `noaa_gsod` dataset provides similar wind speed data and is more manageable within the free tier.
- **Alternative Data Sources:** Consider using publicly available datasets or APIs that offer the required data in a smaller size.

**Next Steps:**

- Decide whether enabling billing is an option for you.
- If not, try using the `noaa_gsod` dataset or another alternative.
- If you need assistance with modifying queries or finding appropriate datasets, feel free to ask!

2025-01-20 12:22:06 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering quota exceeded errors when attempting to run queries on the `icoads_core` tables, even with limited queries:

```sql
-- Query 4: Get data for years between 2005 and 2015 from icoads_core_2008
SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `wind_speed`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2008`
WHERE `year` BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

**Explanation:**

The `icoads_core` tables are extremely large datasets, and BigQuery charges based on the amount of data scanned during a query—not the amount of data returned. Even though you're selecting only a few columns and limiting the results to 1,000 rows, BigQuery needs to scan the entire `year` and `wind_speed` columns in the `icoads_core_2008` table to execute the query. This amount of data scanning exceeds the free tier quota provided by BigQuery.

**Why the Quota Error Occurs:**

- **Data Size:** The `icoads_core_2008` table contains billions of records and spans terabytes of data.
- **Scanning Columns:** BigQuery must scan all the data in the queried columns, even if you use a `LIMIT` clause.
- **Partitioning:** The `icoads_core` tables are not partitioned by `year`, so filtering on `year` does not reduce the amount of data scanned significantly.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   To process queries that exceed the free tier quota, you need to enable billing for your project. This allows you to run larger queries, but you'll incur charges based on the amount of data processed.

   - **Steps to Enable Billing:**

     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Set up a billing account if you don't have one.
     - Link your BigQuery project to the billing account.
     - Set up budget alerts to monitor and control costs.

   - **Cost Considerations:**

     - BigQuery's on-demand pricing is approximately $5 per terabyte of data processed.
     - Use the query validator in the BigQuery UI to estimate the amount of data your query will process before running it.

2. **Use a Smaller or Alternative Dataset:**

   Considering the constraints with the `icoads_core` tables, you might consider using an alternative dataset that contains wind speed data but is smaller in size.

   - **NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) Dataset:**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
     - **Tables:** `gsod2005` to `gsod2015` (one table per year)
     - **Contains daily summaries of weather data, including wind speeds, from land-based weather stations.**

   - **NOAA Hurricanes Dataset:**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes`
     - **Table:** `hurricanes`
     - **Contains data on hurricanes, including dates, locations (latitude and longitude), and wind speeds.**

     **Sample Query Using the Hurricanes Dataset:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       DATE(iso_time) AS date,
       latitude,
       longitude,
       MAX(usa_wind) * 0.514444 AS max_wind_speed_mps  -- Convert knots to meters per second
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM iso_time) BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015
       AND usa_wind IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY
       date, latitude, longitude
     ORDER BY
       max_wind_speed_mps DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

     **Note:** This dataset is much smaller and should process within the free tier quota.

3. **Adjust Your Query to Reduce Data Scanned:**

   If you still prefer to use the `icoads_core` tables, you can try to reduce the amount of data scanned by applying more selective filters:

   - **Filter by Specific Date Range within the Year:**

     ```sql
     SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2008`
     WHERE
       `month` = 8  -- August data only
       AND `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   - **Filter by Geographic Location:**

     ```sql
     SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2008`
     WHERE
       `latitude` BETWEEN 20 AND 30
       AND `longitude` BETWEEN -80 AND -70
       AND `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   However, due to the dataset's size, these filters may still not reduce the data scanned enough to stay within the free tier quota.

---

**Sample Output Format:**

Given the constraints, here's the expected output format:

```csv
Date,Latitude,Longitude,Average_Wind_Speed
date1:date,lat1:float,lon1:float,speed1:float
date2:date,lat2:float,lon2:float,speed2:float
date3:date,lat3:float,lon3:float,speed3:float
date4:date,lat4:float,lon4:float,speed4:float
date5:date,lat5:float,lon5:float,speed5:float
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

Unfortunately, without running the actual queries, I cannot provide the specific values.

---

**Recommendation:**

Given the persistent quota issues, I recommend:

- **Enabling Billing:** If possible, enable billing on your Google Cloud project to process the required queries on the `icoads_core` tables.

- **Using Alternative Datasets:** Utilize smaller datasets like `noaa_hurricanes` or `noaa_gsod` that contain wind speed data and are more manageable within the free tier quota.

- **Exploring Public Datasets or APIs:** Consider other data sources that provide the necessary information without exceeding your quota.

2025-01-20 12:23:04 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering quota errors when attempting to query the `icoads_core` tables. The error message indicates that your query is exceeding the free tier quota in BigQuery due to the large amount of data being scanned.

**Understanding the Issue:**

- **Data Size:** The `icoads_core` tables are extremely large, containing billions of rows with global marine observations. Even simple queries can scan terabytes of data.
- **Quota Limitations:** BigQuery's free tier has a limit of 1 TB of data processing per month. Exceeding this limit results in a quota error.
- **Column Scanning:** BigQuery charges based on the amount of data scanned, not the number of rows returned. Using `LIMIT` does not reduce the data scanned.
- **Partitioning:** The `icoads_core` tables are not partitioned by `year`, so filtering on `year` does not significantly reduce the data scanned.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   To process queries that exceed the free tier quota, you'll need to enable billing on your Google Cloud project. This allows you to run larger queries, but you will incur charges based on the amount of data processed.

   - **Steps to Enable Billing:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Set up a billing account if you don't have one.
     - Link your BigQuery project to the billing account.
     - Set up budget alerts to monitor spending.

   - **Cost Considerations:**
     - BigQuery charges $5 per terabyte of data processed (as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021).
     - Use the BigQuery query validator to estimate costs before running queries.

2. **Use a Smaller or Alternative Dataset:**

   If enabling billing isn't feasible, consider using a different dataset that contains wind speed data but is smaller and within the free tier quota.

   - **NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD):**
     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
     - **Contains:** Daily weather summaries, including wind speed, from land-based stations.
     - **Advantages:** Smaller size makes it more manageable within the free tier quota.

   - **Sample Query Using GSOD Dataset:**

     ```sql
     -- Focus on a single year to reduce data scanned
     WITH daily_wind_speeds AS (
       SELECT
         DATE(CONCAT(year, '-', LPAD(mo, 2, '0'), '-', LPAD(da, 2, '0'))) AS date,
         stn,
         wban,
         CAST(wdsp AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed
       FROM
         `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2008`  -- Select a specific year
       WHERE
         wdsp != '999.9'  -- Exclude missing values
     ),
     avg_wind_speeds AS (
       SELECT
         date,
         stn,
         wban,
         AVG(wind_speed) AS average_wind_speed
       FROM
         daily_wind_speeds
       GROUP BY
         date, stn, wban
     )
     SELECT
       a.date,
       s.lat AS latitude,
       s.lon AS longitude,
       a.average_wind_speed
     FROM
       avg_wind_speeds a
     JOIN
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` s
     ON
       a.stn = s.usaf AND a.wban = s.wban
     ORDER BY
       average_wind_speed DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

     - **Explanation:**
       - **Reduce Data Scope:** Querying a single year's data reduces the amount of data scanned.
       - **Adjust Years Individually:** Repeat the query for each year from 2005 to 2015, individually.
       - **Quota Compliance:** This approach helps stay within the free tier quota.

3. **Consider Alternative Data Sources:**

   If the GSOD dataset doesn't meet your needs, explore other datasets that might be suitable and within quota limits.

   - **NOAA Hurricanes Dataset:**
     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes`
     - **Contains:** Hurricane data, including wind speeds, dates, and locations.
     - **Sample Query:**

       ```sql
       SELECT
         DATE(iso_time) AS date,
         latitude,
         longitude,
         MAX(usa_wind) * 0.514444 AS max_wind_speed_mps  -- Convert knots to m/s
       FROM
         `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
       WHERE
         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM iso_time) BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015
         AND usa_wind IS NOT NULL
       GROUP BY
         date, latitude, longitude
       ORDER BY
         max_wind_speed_mps DESC
       LIMIT 5;
       ```

4. **Download Data for Local Processing:**

   If possible, download a subset of the `icoads_core` data for offline processing.

   - **Steps:**
     - Visit the [ICOADS Data Access page](https://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html).
     - Download data for the specific years and variables you need.
     - Use local tools (e.g., Python, R) to process and analyze the data.

   - **Considerations:**
     - Requires sufficient local storage and processing capabilities.
     - May involve handling large files.

5. **Adjust Your Task Parameters:**

   Given the constraints, you might need to modify your requirements to fit within the quota limits.

   - **Focus on a Shorter Time Span:**
     - Select a single year or a few months for analysis.
   - **Limit Geographic Scope:**
     - Filter data to a specific region known for high wind speeds.

     ```sql
     -- Sample query with geographic filters on GSOD dataset
     SELECT
       DATE(CONCAT(year, '-', LPAD(mo, 2, '0'), '-', LPAD(da, 2, '0'))) AS date,
       s.lat AS latitude,
       s.lon AS longitude,
       CAST(wdsp AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2008` AS g
     JOIN
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS s
     ON
       g.stn = s.usaf AND g.wban = s.wban
     WHERE
       wdsp != '999.9'
       AND s.lat BETWEEN 25 AND 35
       AND s.lon BETWEEN -90 AND -80
     ORDER BY
       wind_speed DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

**Conclusion:**

Given the size of the `icoads_core` tables and the limitations of the BigQuery free tier, querying these tables without exceeding your quota is challenging. Here are your options:

- **Enable Billing:** This allows you to run queries on large datasets like `icoads_core`. Remember to monitor your spending with budgets and alerts.
- **Use Smaller Datasets:** Datasets like `noaa_gsod` or `noaa_hurricanes` may provide the necessary wind speed data without exceeding your quota.
- **Adjust Your Analysis Scope:** Focusing on a smaller time frame or geographic area reduces data scanned.
- **Process Data Locally:** Downloading data for offline processing gives you full control but requires local resources.

**Next Steps:**

- **Decide on Enabling Billing:** If feasible, enable billing to proceed with your original plan.
- **Explore Alternative Datasets:** If billing isn't an option, try using the GSOD or Hurricanes datasets.
- **Modify Queries:** Adjust your queries to reduce data scanned by limiting date ranges or geographic areas.
- **Ask for Assistance:** If you need help modifying queries or exploring datasets, feel free to ask!

2025-01-20 12:23:58 - root - INFO - Hello,

I understand that you're still encountering the **quota exceeded error** when running the following query on the `icoads_core_2008` table:

```sql
-- Query 4: Get data for years between 2005 and 2015 from icoads_core_2008
SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `wind_speed`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2008`
WHERE `year` BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

**Explanation:**

The **`icoads_core` tables are extremely large**, containing billions of records and spanning terabytes of data. BigQuery charges based on the **amount of data scanned** during a query, not the number of rows returned. Even with a `LIMIT` clause and filtering on `year`, BigQuery needs to scan the entire dataset because:

- The tables are **not partitioned** by `year`, so filtering on `year` doesn't significantly reduce the data scanned.
- The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows **returned**, not the amount of data **processed**.

As a result, your query exceeds the free tier quota provided by BigQuery, leading to the quota error.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   To run queries on large datasets like `icoads_core`, you'll need to enable billing:

   - **Enable Billing:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Set up a billing account if you don't have one.
     - Link your BigQuery project to the billing account.
     - Set budgets and alerts to monitor your spending.

   - **Cost Considerations:**
     - BigQuery's on-demand pricing is approximately **$5 per terabyte** of data processed.
     - You can use the query validator in the BigQuery UI to estimate the amount of data your query will process before running it.

2. **Use an Alternative Dataset:**

   Given the limitations with the `icoads_core` tables, consider using a **smaller dataset** that contains wind speed data:

   - **NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD):**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
     - **Tables:** `gsod2005` to `gsod2015` (one table per year)
     - **Contains:** Daily weather summaries, including wind speeds, from land-based weather stations.
     - **Advantages:** Smaller dataset size, more manageable within the free tier quota.
     - **Note:** You've encountered quota issues with this dataset previously, but focusing on a single year or applying more restrictive filters may help.

   - **NOAA Hurricanes Dataset:**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes`
     - **Table:** `hurricanes`
     - **Contains:** Hurricane data with wind speeds, dates, and locations.
     - **Smaller Size:** This dataset is much smaller and likely to stay within the free tier quota.

     **Sample Query Using the Hurricanes Dataset:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       DATE(iso_time) AS date,
       latitude,
       longitude,
       MAX(usa_wind) * 0.514444 AS max_wind_speed_mps  -- Convert knots to meters per second
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM iso_time) BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015
       AND usa_wind IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY
       date, latitude, longitude
     ORDER BY
       max_wind_speed_mps DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

     **Result Format:**

     ```csv
     Date,Latitude,Longitude,Max_Wind_Speed_mps
     date1,lat1,lon1,speed1
     date2,lat2,lon2,speed2
     date3,lat3,lon3,speed3
     date4,lat4,lon4,speed4
     date5,lat5,lon5,speed5
     (Attention: answer in 5 rows)
     ```

3. **Limit the Scope of Your Query Further:**

   If you prefer to use the `icoads_core` tables without enabling billing, you can try to reduce the data scanned by:

   - **Focusing on a Specific Region:**

     ```sql
     SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2008`
     WHERE
       `year` BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015
       AND `latitude` BETWEEN 10 AND 20
       AND `longitude` BETWEEN -50 AND -40
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   - **Focusing on a Specific Time Frame:**

     ```sql
     SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2008`
     WHERE
       `year` = 2008
       AND `month` = 8  -- August data only
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   **Note:** Even with these filters, the data scanned might still exceed the free quota due to the table's size.

4. **Use Public Sample Tables:**

   BigQuery provides sample tables that are small and free to query:

   - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.samples`
   - **Tables:** `natality`, `shakespeare`, `gsod`, etc.

   However, these tables may not contain the wind speed data you require.

---

**Conclusion:**

Given the persistent quota issues, here are your options:

- **Enable Billing:** This will allow you to run queries on large datasets like `icoads_core`. Remember to monitor your usage to control costs.
- **Use Alternative Datasets:** Utilize smaller datasets like `noaa_hurricanes` or focus on specific years or regions within `noaa_gsod` to stay within the free tier quota.
- **Adjust Your Query Scope:** Limit your queries to smaller subsets of the data to reduce the amount of data scanned.

2025-01-20 12:24:33 - root - INFO - Hello,

I understand that despite our efforts to reduce the amount of data scanned, you're still encountering quota exceeded errors when running queries, even on smaller datasets like the `noaa_hurricanes` table. This suggests that the free tier quotas are insufficient for the queries you're attempting to run.

**Possible Reasons:**

- **Free Tier Limitations:**
  - The BigQuery free tier allows up to **1 TB** of data processing per month and **10 GB** of free storage.
  - **Per-Project Daily Limit:** There is also a **per-project daily limit of 20,000 partition modifications and 20,000 data manipulation language statements**.
  - Your project may have already reached its daily or monthly quota limits.

- **Per-User Quota Limits:**
  - There are per-user quotas that limit the amount of data processed per day, which could be causing these errors even with smaller datasets.
  - **Concurrent Rate Limit:** BigQuery enforces a concurrent rate limit that might be impacting your queries.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   To process larger queries that exceed the free tier quota, you need to enable billing on your Google Cloud project.

   - **Enable Billing:**
     - Visit the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Create a billing account if you don't have one.
     - Link your BigQuery project to the billing account.
     - Set up budget alerts to monitor and control your spending.

   - **Cost Considerations:**
     - BigQuery's on-demand pricing is **$5 per terabyte** (TB) of data processed.
     - Use the query estimator in the BigQuery UI to check the amount of data your query will process before running it.
     - Setting a budget can help prevent unexpected charges.

2. **Limit the Data Scanned:**

   If enabling billing is not feasible, you can try to further limit the data scanned in your queries.

   - **Focus on a Single Year or Month:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       DATE(iso_time) AS date,
       latitude,
       longitude,
       MAX(usa_wind) * 0.514444 AS max_wind_speed_mps
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM iso_time) = 2010  -- Focus on a single year
       AND usa_wind IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY
       date, latitude, longitude
     ORDER BY
       max_wind_speed_mps DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

   - **Filter by Specific Storms or Regions:**

     Identify and filter data for specific storms known for high wind speeds within the desired time frame.

   - **Estimate Query Size:**

     Use the BigQuery UI to estimate how much data your query will scan before running it.

3. **Use Public Sample Tables:**

   Utilize smaller sample datasets provided by BigQuery that are free to query.

   - **Sample Dataset:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       *
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.samples.gsod`
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     Note that sample datasets may not contain the specific data you need.

4. **Alternative Data Sources:**

   Use alternative data sources or APIs that provide pre-aggregated or summarized wind speed data.

   - **NOAA APIs:**

     - **NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) Web Services:**
       - Provides access to NOAA's climate data.
       - [API Documentation](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2)

   - **Third-Party Datasets:**

     - Datasets available on platforms like Kaggle or other open data repositories.

5. **Process Data Locally:**

   Download the data and perform analysis locally or in an environment where you have more control over resources.

   - **Steps:**
     - Access the data via NOAA's FTP servers or HTTP directories.
     - Download only the necessary subsets to minimize data size.
     - Process the data using tools like Python or R.

   - **Considerations:**
     - Requires sufficient local storage and computing resources.
     - May involve handling large files and data processing tasks.

**Conclusion:**

Given the persistent quota errors, it's likely that the queries you're running exceed the limitations of the BigQuery free tier. Enabling billing on your Google Cloud project is the most effective way to proceed, as it allows you to process larger datasets and run more complex queries.

If enabling billing isn't an option, consider adjusting your analysis to work with smaller subsets of data or using alternative data sources that fit within the free tier quotas.

Please let me know if you need assistance with any of these steps or if you have questions about modifying your queries to reduce data usage. I'm here to help you achieve your data analysis goals!

2025-01-20 12:25:34 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering quota errors when attempting to run queries on the `icoads_core` datasets. The error message indicates that your project has exceeded the quota for free query bytes scanned in BigQuery:

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you're using a `LIMIT` clause and applying filters, BigQuery charges based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned. The `icoads_core` datasets are extremely large, often containing billions of rows and spanning terabytes of data. As a result, even simple queries can exceed the free tier quota.

**Why Your Query Exceeds the Quota:**

- **Dataset Size:** The `icoads_core_2010` table is massive. Even querying a few columns can result in scanning terabytes of data.
- **Limitations of `LIMIT`:** The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows **returned**, not the amount of data **scanned**.
- **Filtering on Non-Partitioned Columns:** The `icoads_core` tables are not partitioned by `year` or `wind_speed`, so filtering on these columns doesn't significantly reduce the data scanned.
- **BigQuery's Free Tier Quota:** The free tier allows up to **1 TB** of data processing per month. Your queries are likely exceeding this limit due to the size of the dataset.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   To process queries that exceed the free tier quota, you can enable billing on your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to run larger queries, but you'll be charged based on the amount of data processed.

   - **Steps to Enable Billing:**

     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Create a billing account if you haven't already.
     - Link your BigQuery project to the billing account.
     - Set up budgets and alerts to monitor and control your spending.

   - **Cost Considerations:**

     - BigQuery charges **$5 per terabyte** of data processed (as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021).
     - Use the BigQuery query validator to estimate how much data your queries will process before running them.

2. **Use a Smaller or Alternative Dataset:**

   If enabling billing isn't an option, consider using a smaller dataset that provides similar information.

   - **NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD):**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
     - **Tables:** `gsod2005` to `gsod2015` (one table per year)
     - **Contains:** Daily summaries of weather data, including wind speeds, from land-based weather stations.

     **Sample Query Using the GSOD Dataset:**

     ```sql
     -- Retrieve the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds between 2005 and 2015
     WITH daily_wind_speeds AS (
       SELECT
         DATE(CONCAT(year, '-', mo, '-', da)) AS date,
         stn,
         wban,
         CAST(wdsp AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed
       FROM
         `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
       WHERE
         _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2005' AND '2015'
         AND wdsp != '999.9'  -- Exclude missing values
     ),
     avg_wind_speeds AS (
       SELECT
         date,
         stn,
         wban,
         AVG(wind_speed) AS average_wind_speed
       FROM
         daily_wind_speeds
       GROUP BY
         date, stn, wban
     )
     SELECT
       a.date,
       s.lat AS latitude,
       s.lon AS longitude,
       a.average_wind_speed
     FROM
       avg_wind_speeds a
     JOIN
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` s
     ON
       a.stn = s.usaf AND a.wban = s.wban
     ORDER BY
       average_wind_speed DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

     **Note:** The GSOD dataset is smaller, but depending on your previous usage, you may still encounter quota issues.

   - **NOAA Hurricanes Dataset:**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes`
     - **Table:** `hurricanes`
     - **Contains:** Hurricane data, including wind speeds, dates, and locations.

     **Sample Query Using the Hurricanes Dataset:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       DATE(iso_time) AS date,
       latitude,
       longitude,
       MAX(usa_wind) * 0.514444 AS max_wind_speed_mps  -- Convert knots to meters per second
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM iso_time) BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015
       AND usa_wind IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY
       date, latitude, longitude
     ORDER BY
       max_wind_speed_mps DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

     **Note:** This dataset is smaller, but as per your error message, querying it may still exceed your quota.

3. **Limit the Data Scanned in Your Queries:**

   Applying filters can sometimes reduce the amount of data scanned. However, with very large tables like `icoads_core`, even filtered queries can exceed the quota.

   - **Filter by Specific Region and Time:**

     ```sql
     SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010`
     WHERE
       `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
       AND `year` = 2010
       AND `month` = 8  -- August
       AND `latitude` BETWEEN 10 AND 20
       AND `longitude` BETWEEN -50 AND -40
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     **Caution:** Due to the dataset's size, this may not reduce the data scanned enough to stay within the free quota.

   - **Use Sampling:**

     ```sql
     SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010` TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (0.01 PERCENT)
     WHERE
       `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
       AND `year` = 2010
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     **Note:** Even with sampling, the data scanned may still exceed your quota due to the table's size.

4. **Download Data for Local Processing:**

   If possible, consider downloading a subset of the data for local analysis.

   - **Accessing Data:**

     - You can download ICOADS data files from the [ICOADS website](https://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html).
     - Select specific years or regions to reduce the data volume.

   - **Processing Locally:**

     - Use data analysis tools like Python or R.
     - Requires sufficient local storage and computing resources.

5. **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

   Consider using other data sources or APIs that provide wind speed information.

   - **NOAA APIs:**

     - **NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI):**
       - Provides access to various climate and weather datasets.
       - [NCEI Data Access](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access)

     - **NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) APIs:**
       - [CDO Web Services](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2)

   - **Third-Party Datasets:**

     - Look for wind speed datasets on platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/).

6. **Contact Support or Request a Quota Increase:**

   If you believe you're encountering an error or if you have a valid use case that requires higher quotas, you might consider contacting Google Cloud support to discuss your needs.

**Summary:**

- **Enabling Billing** is the most straightforward way to resolve the quota issue and proceed with your queries.
- If billing isn't an option, **using smaller datasets** or **processing data locally** are alternatives, though they may require adjusting your analysis.
- **Adjusting your queries** to significantly reduce the data scanned is challenging with large datasets like `icoads_core`.

**Next Steps:**

- **Evaluate Your Options:**

  - If possible, enable billing on your project to process large queries.
  - If not, consider focusing on smaller datasets or alternative data sources.

- **Estimate Query Costs:**

  - Use the BigQuery UI to preview and estimate the amount of data your queries will process before running them.

- **Set Budgets and Alerts:**

  - If you enable billing, set up budgets and alerts to monitor your spending and avoid unexpected charges.

**I'm here to help you navigate these options. Please let me know if you need assistance with enabling billing, modifying your queries, or exploring alternative datasets.**

2025-01-20 12:26:34 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the "Quota exceeded" error when attempting to query the `icoads_core` dataset, even with filters and limits applied:

```sql
-- Query 5: Retrieve observations where wind_speed is not null and year is 2010 from icoads_core_2010
SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `wind_speed`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010`
WHERE `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL AND `year` = 2010
LIMIT 1000
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

**Explanation:**

The `icoads_core` tables are exceptionally large, containing billions of rows and spanning terabytes of data. BigQuery charges based on the amount of data **scanned** during a query, not the number of rows returned. Even with a `LIMIT` clause and filters applied, BigQuery must scan the entire `wind_speed` column (and other columns used in the query) to execute the query, which exceeds the free tier quota.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   To process queries that exceed the free tier quota, you'll need to enable billing on your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to run larger queries, but you will incur charges based on the amount of data processed.

   **Steps to Enable Billing:**

   - **Create a Billing Account:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - If you don't have a billing account, follow the prompts to set one up.
   
   - **Link Your Project to the Billing Account:**
     - In the Cloud Console, select your project.
     - Navigate to **Billing** and link your project to your billing account.

   - **Set Budgets and Alerts (Optional but Recommended):**
     - To avoid unexpected charges, set up budgets and alerts.
     - Navigate to **Billing** > **Budgets & alerts** in the Cloud Console.

   **Cost Considerations:**

   - BigQuery's on-demand pricing is approximately **$5 per terabyte (TB)** of data processed.
   - You can use the BigQuery query editor to **estimate** the amount of data your query will process before running it.
   
   **Benefits:**

   - Enables you to run queries without being constrained by the free tier quota.
   - Allows you to access and process large datasets like `icoads_core`.

2. **Use Smaller or Alternative Datasets:**

   If enabling billing isn't feasible, consider using smaller datasets that provide similar information:

   - **NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD):**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
     - **Contains:** Daily summaries of weather data, including wind speeds, from land-based weather stations.
     - **Advantages:** Significantly smaller than `icoads_core` datasets, reducing the likelihood of exceeding the free tier quota.

     **Sample Query Using GSOD Dataset:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       DATE(CONCAT(year, '-', mo, '-', da)) AS date,
       stn,
       wban,
       CAST(wdsp AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2010`
     WHERE
       wdsp != '999.9'  -- Exclude missing wind speed values
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     **Note:** Even with smaller datasets, ensure that the estimated data processed is within your free tier quota.

   - **Other Public Datasets or APIs:**

     - Search for alternative datasets or APIs that provide wind speed data for the years and locations you're interested in.
     - Examples include datasets hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or APIs provided by meteorological organizations.

3. **Limit the Scope of Your Query:**

   Try to further reduce the amount of data scanned by:

   - **Focusing on Specific Geographic Regions:**
   
     ```sql
     SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010`
     WHERE
       `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
       AND `year` = 2010
       AND `latitude` BETWEEN 10 AND 20  -- Specific latitude range
       AND `longitude` BETWEEN -50 AND -40  -- Specific longitude range
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   - **Targeting Specific Time Frames:**

     ```sql
     SELECT `year`, `month`, `day`, `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010`
     WHERE
       `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
       AND `year` = 2010
       AND `month` = 9  -- September data only
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

   **Caution:** Due to the size of the `icoads_core` datasets, these filters may not reduce the data scanned sufficiently to stay within the free tier quota.

4. **Process Data Locally:**

   If possible, consider downloading a subset of the data for local analysis:

   - **Download ICOADS Data:**
     - Access ICOADS data directly from the [ICOADS website](https://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html).
     - Download specific subsets of data (e.g., certain years, regions, or variables) to minimize data size.

   - **Local Processing:**
     - Use data analysis tools like Python or R to process and analyze the data on your local machine or a cloud instance where you have control over resource usage.

   **Considerations:**

   - Requires sufficient local storage and computational resources.
   - Data files can still be large, so downloading may take time and bandwidth.

5. **Contact Google Cloud Support:**

   If you believe you're encountering this error in error or need assistance with your quota, you can reach out to [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support-hub) for further guidance.

---

**Summary:**

- The "Quota exceeded" error occurs because your queries are scanning more data than allowed under the BigQuery free tier quota.
- Enabling billing on your Google Cloud project is the most effective way to resolve this issue, allowing you to run queries that process large volumes of data.
- If enabling billing isn't an option, consider alternative datasets, limit the scope of your queries, or process data locally.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Decide Whether to Enable Billing:**

   - Evaluate if enabling billing is feasible for your project.
   - If you proceed, set up budgets and alerts to manage costs.

2. **Explore Alternative Datasets:**

   - Look for smaller datasets that contain the wind speed data you need.
   - Ensure that querying these datasets stays within your quota limits.

3. **Adjust Your Analysis:**

   - Limit your queries to smaller regions or time frames to reduce data scanned.
   - Be mindful that even with limitations, some datasets may still exceed your quota.

4. **Local Analysis:**

   - If appropriate, download and analyze the data locally using tools you're comfortable with.

2025-01-20 12:27:29 - root - INFO - Hello,

I see that you're still encountering the quota exceeded error when running your query:

```sql
-- Query 6: Find the top wind_speed values from icoads_core_2009
SELECT `wind_speed`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009`

ORDER BY `wind_speed` DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

**Explanation:**

The `icoads_core` tables are extremely large datasets, containing billions of rows and spanning terabytes of data. BigQuery charges based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned. Even though you're selecting only the `wind_speed` column and limiting the results to 1,000 rows, BigQuery must scan the entire `wind_speed` column to sort all values and determine the top wind speeds. This operation involves reading the entire column, which exceeds the free tier quota.

Furthermore, using `ORDER BY` on a column in BigQuery requires scanning all the data for that column to perform the sorting operation.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   To process large queries that exceed the free tier quota, you need to enable billing on your Google Cloud project. This will allow you to run queries without encountering quota errors, but you'll be charged based on the amount of data processed.

   **Steps to Enable Billing:**

   - **Create a Billing Account:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Follow the prompts to set up a billing account if you don't already have one.

   - **Link Your Project to the Billing Account:**
     - In the Cloud Console, select your project.
     - Navigate to **Billing** and link your project to your billing account.

   - **Set Up Budgets and Alerts:**
     - To avoid unexpected charges, set up budgets and alerts.
     - Navigate to **Billing** > **Budgets & alerts** in the Cloud Console.

   **Cost Considerations:**

   - BigQuery's on-demand pricing is approximately **$5 per terabyte (TB)** of data processed.
   - Use the BigQuery query editor to **estimate** the amount of data your query will process before running it.

2. **Use Alternative Datasets or Pre-Aggregated Data:**

   If enabling billing isn't feasible, consider using smaller datasets or pre-aggregated data that fit within the free tier quota.

   - **NOAA GSOD Dataset (Global Surface Summary of the Day):**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
     - **Contains:** Daily summaries of weather data, including wind speeds from land-based stations.
     - **Advantage:** Significantly smaller than `icoads_core` datasets.

     **Sample Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       DATE(CONCAT(year, '-', mo, '-', da)) AS date,
       CAST(wdsp AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed,

     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2009`
     WHERE
       wdsp != '999.9'
     ORDER BY
       wind_speed DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

     - `wdsp` represents the mean wind speed for the day in knots to tenths.
     - You can join with the `stations` table to get latitude and longitude.

   - **NOAA Hurricanes Dataset:**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
     - **Contains:** Data on hurricanes, including wind speeds, dates, and locations.

     **Sample Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       DATE(iso_time) AS date,
       usa_latitude AS latitude,
       usa_longitude AS longitude,
       MAX(usa_wind) AS max_wind_speed_knots
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM iso_time) = 2009
       AND usa_wind IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY
       date, latitude, longitude
     ORDER BY
       max_wind_speed_knots DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

     - `usa_wind` is in knots. You can convert it to meters per second if needed.

3. **Reduce Data Scanned by Filtering and Sampling:**

   You can attempt to reduce the amount of data scanned by applying more restrictive filters and using sampling.

   **Sampling with `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009` TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (0.1 PERCENT)
   WHERE
     `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY
     `wind_speed` DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Note:** Even with sampling, ordering by `wind_speed DESC` may still scan more data than allowed in the free tier.

   **Limit to Specific Regions or Time Frames:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009`
   WHERE
     `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
     AND `latitude` BETWEEN 10 AND 20
     AND `longitude` BETWEEN -50 AND -40
     AND `month` = 9  -- September
   ORDER BY
     `wind_speed` DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   Even with these filters, the data scanned might still exceed the quota due to the dataset's size.

4. **Remove the `ORDER BY` Clause:**

   Since the `ORDER BY` operation requires scanning and sorting the entire column, removing it can significantly reduce the data scanned.

   ```sql
   SELECT `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009`
   WHERE
     `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Caution:** Without ordering, the results will be arbitrary, and you won't get the top wind speed values.

5. **Process Data Locally:**

   Consider downloading a subset of the data and processing it locally or on a platform where you have more control over resources and costs.

   - **Download Data:**
     - Access datasets from [NOAA ICOADS](https://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html).
     - Download data for specific years or regions to limit the size.

   - **Process Data Using Local Tools:**
     - Use programming languages like Python or R for data analysis.

6. **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

   Explore other public datasets or APIs that provide wind speed data without exceeding your quota.

   - **NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO):**
     - Provides access to a wide range of climate data.
     - [CDO Web Services API](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2)
     - You can retrieve data programmatically within usage limits.

   - **National Data Buoy Center (NDBC):**
     - Offers real-time and historical data from buoy stations.
     - Data is available via [FTP](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/) or web services.

**Conclusion:**

Given the persistent quota errors and the size of the `icoads_core` datasets, it's challenging to retrieve the desired data without exceeding the free tier limits. Enabling billing on your Google Cloud project is the most effective way to proceed, as it allows you to process larger datasets. If that's not an option, consider using alternative datasets like NOAA GSOD or Hurricanes, which are smaller and may fit within your quota.

2025-01-20 12:28:14 - root - INFO - Hello,

I understand that you're still encountering quota errors when attempting to query the `icoads_core` datasets, even after applying filters and limits:

```sql
-- Query 6: Find the top wind_speed values from icoads_core_2009
SELECT `wind_speed`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009`
WHERE `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY `wind_speed` DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

**Explanation:**

The `icoads_core` tables are exceptionally large, containing billions of rows and spanning terabytes of data. BigQuery charges based on the amount of data **scanned** during a query, not the number of rows returned. Even with the `LIMIT` clause and filters, BigQuery needs to scan the entire `wind_speed` column to perform the `ORDER BY` operation, which exceeds the free query quota.

**Why This Happens:**

- **Data Size:** The size of the `icoads_core` tables means any query scanning even a single column can process terabytes of data.
- **Ordering Data:** The `ORDER BY` clause requires scanning and sorting all values in the column, which increases data processing.
- **Quota Limitations:** The BigQuery free tier allows up to 1 TB of data processing per month. Your query exceeds this limit.

---

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   Enabling billing will allow you to process queries that exceed the free tier quota. You'll be charged based on the amount of data processed.

   **Steps to Enable Billing:**

   - **Create a Billing Account:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
     - Follow the prompts to set up a billing account.

   - **Link Your Project to the Billing Account:**
     - In the Cloud Console, select your project.
     - Navigate to **Billing** and link your project to your billing account.

   - **Set Budgets and Alerts:**
     - Set up budgets and alerts to monitor your spending.
     - Navigate to **Billing** > **Budgets & alerts**.

   **Cost Considerations:**

   - BigQuery's on-demand pricing is **$5 per terabyte (TB)** of data processed.
   - Use the BigQuery query editor to **estimate** the amount of data your query will process before running it.

2. **Use Alternative Datasets:**

   If enabling billing isn't feasible, consider using smaller datasets that provide similar information.

   - **NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD):**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`
     - **Contains:** Daily summaries of weather data, including wind speeds from land-based stations.
     - **Advantage:** Significantly smaller than `icoads_core` datasets.

     **Sample Query Using GSOD Dataset:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       DATE(CONCAT(year, '-', mo, '-', da)) AS date,
       CAST(wdsp AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed,
       stn,
       wban
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2009`
     WHERE
       wdsp != '999.9'  -- Exclude missing values
     ORDER BY
       wind_speed DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

     - You can join with the `stations` table to get latitude and longitude.

   - **NOAA Hurricanes Dataset:**

     - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes`
     - **Contains:** Data on hurricanes, including wind speeds, dates, and locations.
     - **Smaller Size:** Likely to fit within free quota limits.

     **Sample Query Using Hurricanes Dataset:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       DATE(iso_time) AS date,
       latitude,
       longitude,
       MAX(usa_wind) * 0.514444 AS max_wind_speed_mps  -- Convert knots to meters per second
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
     WHERE
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM iso_time) BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015
       AND usa_wind IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY
       date, latitude, longitude
     ORDER BY
       max_wind_speed_mps DESC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```

3. **Adjust Your Query to Reduce Data Scanned:**

   Removing the `ORDER BY` clause can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned, although you won't get the top values.

   ```sql
   SELECT `wind_speed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009`
   WHERE
     `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   However, even without `ORDER BY`, queries on `icoads_core` tables may still exceed the free quota due to their size.

4. **Process Data Locally:**

   You can download subsets of the data for offline processing.

   - **Download Data:**
     - Access data from the [ICOADS website](https://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html).
     - Download specific data subsets (e.g., certain years or regions).

   - **Process Locally:**
     - Use tools like Python or R for data analysis.

   **Considerations:**

   - Requires sufficient local storage and computational resources.
   - Data files can be large, and downloading may be time-consuming.

---

**Conclusion:**

Given the persistent quota errors and the size of the `icoads_core` datasets, it's not feasible to retrieve the desired data without enabling billing. Here are your options:

- **Enable Billing:**

  - This is the most effective way to proceed with your queries on `icoads_core` datasets.
  - Allows you to process large amounts of data without encountering quota errors.

- **Use Alternative Datasets:**

  - Datasets like `noaa_gsod` or `noaa_hurricanes` are smaller and more manageable within the free tier quota.
  - May provide the necessary wind speed data for your analysis.

- **Adjust Query Scope:**

  - Even with adjustments, querying `icoads_core` tables may still exceed free quotas.
  - Focusing on significantly smaller subsets may help but may not yield meaningful results.

**Next Steps:**

- **Evaluate Enabling Billing:**

  - Consider whether enabling billing aligns with your project's needs and budget.
  - If you proceed, set up budgets and alerts to manage costs.

- **Explore Alternative Datasets:**

  - Use the sample queries provided to work with smaller datasets.
  - Check the estimated data processed before running queries.

- **Process Data Locally:**

  - If local processing is viable, download the data and analyze it offline.

2025-01-20 12:29:10 - root - INFO - Hello,

I see that you're still encountering the quota exceeded error when attempting to run your query:

```sql
-- Query 6: Find the top wind_speed values from icoads_core_2009
SELECT `wind_speed`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009`
WHERE `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY `wind_speed` DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

**Explanation:**

The `icoads_core` tables in the `noaa_icoads` dataset are extremely large, containing billions of records and spanning terabytes of data. BigQuery charges are based on the **amount of data scanned**, not the number of rows returned. Even with a `LIMIT` clause, BigQuery needs to scan the entire `wind_speed` column to perform the `ORDER BY` operation, which involves reading all values to determine the top ones. This results in scanning a volume of data that exceeds the free query quota.

**Why This Happens:**

- **Data Size:** The `icoads_core_2009` table is massive. Even querying a single column can involve scanning hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes of data.
- **`ORDER BY` Clause:** Sorting requires BigQuery to process all values in the `wind_speed` column to determine the correct order.
- **Free Tier Quota:** The BigQuery free tier allows up to **1 TB** of data processing per month. Your query exceeds this limit due to the dataset's size and the operation's requirements.

---

**Options to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Enable Billing on Your Google Cloud Project:**

   The most straightforward way to resolve this issue is to enable billing on your Google Cloud project. This will lift the free tier limits and allow you to process larger queries.

   - **Steps to Enable Billing:**

     - **Create a Billing Account:**

       - Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
       - If you don't have a billing account, create one by following the prompts.

     - **Link Your Project to the Billing Account:**

       - In the Cloud Console, select your project.
       - Navigate to **Billing** from the left-hand menu.
       - Link your project to your billing account.

     - **Set Budget Alerts (Recommended):**

       - Set up budgets and alerts to monitor your spending.
       - Navigate to **Billing** > **Budgets & alerts**.

   - **Cost Considerations:**

     - BigQuery's on-demand pricing is **$5 per terabyte (TB)** of data processed.
     - Use the Query Validator in the BigQuery UI to estimate the amount of data your query will process before running it.
     - For this query, processing the `wind_speed` column from `icoads_core_2009` may involve scanning **hundreds of gigabytes** or even **terabytes** of data.

2. **Modify Your Query to Reduce Data Scanned:**

   If enabling billing is not an option, you can try to reduce the amount of data scanned by:

   - **Removing the `ORDER BY` Clause:**

     The `ORDER BY` operation requires scanning and sorting the entire column, which increases data processed. Without `ORDER BY`, BigQuery can return the first 1,000 rows without scanning the entire column.

     ```sql
     SELECT `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009`
     WHERE `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     However, this will return arbitrary `wind_speed` values, not necessarily the highest ones.

   - **Applying Filters to Narrow Down the Data:**

     Use filters to limit the data scanned. For example, focus on a specific geographic area or time period known for high wind speeds.

     ```sql
     SELECT `wind_speed`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009`
     WHERE
       `wind_speed` IS NOT NULL
       AND `latitude` BETWEEN 20 AND 30
       AND `longitude` BETWEEN -80 AND -70
       AND `month` = 9  -- September
     ORDER BY `wind_speed` DESC
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     **Note:** Due to the dataset's size, even with filters, the query may still exceed the free quota, especially with the `ORDER BY` clause.

3. **Use a Smaller or Pre-Aggregated Dataset:**

   Consider using a dataset that is smaller and more manageable within the free quota, such as the **NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)** dataset.

   - **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`

   **Example Query Using GSOD Dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     CAST(CONCAT(year, '-', mo, '-', da) AS DATE) AS date,
     s.lat AS latitude,
     s.lon AS longitude,
     CAST(wdsp AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2009` AS g
   INNER JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS s
   ON
     g.stn = s.usaf AND g.wban = s.wban
   WHERE
     wdsp != '999.9'  -- Exclude missing values
   ORDER BY
     wind_speed DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   - **Advantages:**

     - The GSOD dataset is much smaller, so your query is more likely to stay within the free quota.
     - You can obtain the top wind speed values along with dates and locations.

4. **Use Public Datasets with Sample Data:**

   Explore datasets that are designed to be small and free to query.

   - **Sample Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.samples.gsod`

   **Example Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.gsod`
   ORDER BY wind_speed DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   - **Note:**

     - This sample dataset may not have the specific data you need.
     - It's useful for testing and learning SQL without exceeding quotas.

5. **Download Data for Local Processing:**

   If possible, you can download the data and analyze it locally using your own resources.

   - **Steps:**

     - Download the ICOADS data for the year 2009 from the [ICOADS website](https://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html).
     - Use data processing tools (e.g., Python, R) to read and analyze the data.
     - This avoids BigQuery quotas but requires sufficient storage and computational resources on your local machine.

6. **Use Alternative Data Sources:**

   Consider using other data sources or APIs that provide wind speed data without exceeding your quota.

   - **NOAA APIs:**

     - **Climate Data Online (CDO) Web Services:**
       - Provides access to NOAA's climate data.
       - [API Documentation](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2)

     - **National Data Buoy Center (NDBC):**
       - Offers real-time and historical data from buoy stations.
       - Data is available via [FTP](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/) or web services.

---

**Summary:**

- The quota exceeded error occurs because your query requires scanning a vast amount of data, which surpasses the free tier limits.
- Enabling billing is the most effective solution, allowing you to run the query with an understanding of the associated costs.
- If enabling billing is not possible, consider alternative datasets or adjust your analysis to work within the free quota.

**Alternative Plan:**

Given the challenges, if obtaining the highest wind speeds is essential, and enabling billing is not an option, you might consider:

- **Focus on Smaller Regions or Specific Events:**

  Limit your query to a smaller geographic area or time period where high wind speeds are more likely (e.g., hurricane-prone regions or known storm events).

- **Use Datasets Specific to High Wind Events:**

  Explore datasets dedicated to significant wind events, such as hurricanes or severe storms, which are smaller in size but contain relevant high wind speed data.

---

**Final Thoughts:**

I understand that running into these quota limitations can be frustrating. BigQuery's free tier is designed for small-scale queries and learning purposes. Processing large datasets, like the `icoads_core` tables with billions of records, typically requires enabling billing due to the significant amount of data scanned.

Please let me know if you need further assistance with any of these options or if you have questions about modifying your queries or finding alternative data sources. I'm here to help you achieve your data analysis goals!
