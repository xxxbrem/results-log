Upon comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query.

All three SQL queries aim to find the female baby name in Wyoming for the year 2021 with the highest proportion relative to the total number of babies given that name across all states. They all correctly calculate the proportion and produce the same result, identifying **'Bentley'** with a proportion of **0.0625** as the most popular name based on this criterion.

I chose `0result.sql` because it clearly and efficiently performs the required calculation, using meaningful aliases and correctly sorting the results with the `ORDER BY` clause to identify the name with the highest proportion.
