The columns relevant to the task are:

- **`category`**: Potential usage - To group articles into different categories and count the total number of articles per category.
- **`body`**: Potential usage - To search for articles that mention "education" within the article text.

Conditions that may be used:

- **`WHERE LOWER(body) LIKE '%education%'`**: To find articles that mention "education" regardless of case sensitivity.

Here are 10 simple, short, non-nested BigQuery SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

```sql
-- 1. Get a distinct list of all categories.
SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. Count the total number of articles per category.
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_articles
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
GROUP BY category
LIMIT 1000;

-- 3. Retrieve titles of articles that mention "education" in the body.
SELECT title
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
WHERE LOWER(body) LIKE '%education%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 4. Count the number of articles mentioning "education" per category.
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS education_articles
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
WHERE LOWER(body) LIKE '%education%'
GROUP BY category
LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. List the filenames of articles in each category.
SELECT category, filename
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
LIMIT 1000;

-- 6. Retrieve the first 1000 article titles and their categories.
SELECT title, category
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
LIMIT 1000;

-- 7. Find articles where the title contains the word "education".
SELECT title, category
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%education%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 8. Get the total number of articles that mention "education".
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_education_articles
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
WHERE LOWER(body) LIKE '%education%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 9. List all article titles and categories where the body text is not empty.
SELECT title, category
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
WHERE body IS NOT NULL AND body != ''
LIMIT 1000;

-- 10. Calculate the average length of articles per category.
SELECT category, AVG(LENGTH(body)) AS average_body_length
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
GROUP BY category
LIMIT 1000;
```

These queries help in understanding:

- The different categories available and their distribution of articles.
- How many articles mention "education" within each category.
- The titles and filenames associated with articles mentioning "education".
- General statistics like the average length of articles per category.

By analyzing the outputs of these queries, you can gather insights necessary to compute the breakdown of total articles into different categories and determine the percentage of articles that mention "education" within each category.Query:

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News is as follows:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'bbc_news': ['fulltext']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 06:01:09 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News is as follows:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
