- `WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%education%'`: To find articles that mention "education" in the title.

Here are 10 simple, short, non-nested BigQuery SQL queries:

1. **Select distinct categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `category` 
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Count total number of articles per category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `category`, COUNT(*) AS total_articles 
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
   GROUP BY `category` 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **List article titles and categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `category` 
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Find articles where the body mentions "education":**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `category` 
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
   WHERE LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%' 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Count articles mentioning "education" per category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `category`, COUNT(*) AS education_articles 
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
   WHERE LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%' 
   GROUP BY `category` 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List article filenames and categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `filename`, `category` 
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Find articles where the title mentions "education":**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `category` 
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%education%' 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Count articles where the title mentions "education" per category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `category`, COUNT(*) AS education_title_articles 
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%education%' 
   GROUP BY `category` 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Find articles mentioning "education" or "school" in the body:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `category` 
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
   WHERE LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%' OR LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%school%' 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Get the average length of article bodies per category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `category`, AVG(LENGTH(`body`)) AS average_body_length 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext` 
    GROUP BY `category` 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries will help in understanding the data and extracting the necessary information to provide a breakdown of the total number of articles in different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category.Query:

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News is as follows:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'bbc_news': ['fulltext']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 06:00:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News is as follows:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
