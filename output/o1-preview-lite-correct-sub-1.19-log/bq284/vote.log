After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **`2result.sql`** considers articles where the word "education" appears in either the `body` **or** the `title`. This approach is more comprehensive and aligns with the total number of articles mentioning "education" as indicated in the earlier query:
  
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_education_articles
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
  WHERE LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%' OR LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%education%'
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```
  
  This query returned **100 articles**, suggesting that some articles mention "education" only in the `title`.

- **`0result.sql`** only searches for "education" in the `body` of the articles. This means it may miss articles where "education" is mentioned solely in the `title`.

By including both the `body` and the `title`, **`2result.sql`** provides a more accurate breakdown of articles mentioning "education" within each category.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
2result.sql
```
