Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, we'll use the `crime_by_lsoa` table from the `bigquery-public-data.london_crime` dataset.

---

**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`

  - `borough`: **Potential Usage** - Filter records to only include data for the borough of Barking and Dagenham.
  - `major_category`: **Potential Usage** - Group and count incidents by major crime categories.
  - `value`: **Potential Usage** - Sum this column to get the total number of incidents.
  - `minor_category`: **Potential Usage** - Explore detailed subcategories of crimes.
  - `year`, `month`: **Potential Usage** - Analyze trends over specific years or months if needed.
  - `lsoa_code`: **Potential Usage** - Identify specific geographic areas within the borough.

---

**Conditions to be Used:**

- `WHERE borough = 'Barking and Dagenham'`: Filters data for the specified borough.
- Potential use of `LOWER(borough)` for case-insensitive matching.
- Grouping by `major_category` to aggregate incident counts.
- Summing the `value` column to get total incidents per category.

Task: Please provide a list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents
Violence Against the Person,count1:int
Theft and Handling,count2:int
Criminal Damage,count3:int
```

**Explanation:** This table lists the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category. The categories are ranked based on the total number of incidents reported..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'london_crime': ['crime_by_lsoa'], 'london_fire_brigade': ['fire_brigade_service_calls']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

**Explanation:** This query selects the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham by:

- Filtering records where the `borough` is 'Barking and Dagenham'.
- Grouping the data by `major_category`.
- Summing the `value` column to calculate the total number of incidents per category.
- Ordering the results in descending order based on `Number_of_Incidents`.
- Limiting the output to the top three categories.

The resulting data shows that the top three crime categories are:

1. **Theft and Handling** with 50,999 incidents.
