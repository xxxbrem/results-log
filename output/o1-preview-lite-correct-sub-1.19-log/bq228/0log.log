**Explanation:**

The error occurred because of a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause. The string literal `'Barking and Dagenham'` was not properly closed with a single quote. In the original queries, a backtick `` ` `` was used instead of a closing single quote `'`.

By correcting the closing quotation mark to a single quote, the string literal is now properly closed, resolving the "Unclosed string literal" syntax error.

**Summary of Corrections:**

- Replaced the backtick `` ` `` after `'Barking and Dagenham` with a single quote `'`.
- Ensured that all string literals use matching single quotes.

Task: Please provide a list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents
Violence Against the Person,count1:int
Theft and Handling,count2:int
Criminal Damage,count3:int
```

**Explanation:** This table lists the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category. The categories are ranked based on the total number of incidents reported..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'london_crime': ['crime_by_lsoa'], 'london_fire_brigade': ['fire_brigade_service_calls']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents
Violence Against the Person,count1:int
Theft and Handling,count2:int
Criminal Damage,count3:int
```

**Explanation:** This table lists the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category. The categories are ranked based on the total number of incidents reported. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
