2025-01-20 04:45:43 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a missing closing single quote in your `WHERE` clause. You have a backtick (\`) instead of a single quote (') at the end of the string `'Barking and Dagenham\``. This leads to an unclosed string literal, causing the syntax error.

Here's the problematic part of your query:

```sql
WHERE `borough` = 'Barking and Dagenham` AND `lsoa_code` IS NOT NULL
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- 9. Get sample LSOA codes in Barking and Dagenham
SELECT DISTINCT `lsoa_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
WHERE `borough` = 'Barking and Dagenham' AND `lsoa_code` IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **String Literals vs. Identifiers:**
  - **String Literals:** Should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`. They represent textual data.
  - **Identifiers:** Such as table names or column names that might conflict with SQL keywords or contain special characters are enclosed in backticks `` `...` ``.
- In your query, `'Barking and Dagenham` starts with a single quote but ends with a backtick, which is incorrect.
- By replacing the backtick with a single quote, you properly close the string literal.

**Summary of Corrections:**

- Replaced the backtick after `'Barking and Dagenham\`` with a single quote `'` to properly close the string.
- Ensured that the string literal is correctly enclosed in single quotes: `'Barking and Dagenham'`.

**Updated Query for Reference:**

```sql
-- 9. Get sample LSOA codes in Barking and Dagenham
SELECT DISTINCT `lsoa_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
WHERE `borough` = 'Barking and Dagenham' AND `lsoa_code` IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

This corrected query should run without the syntax error and return the distinct `lsoa_code` values for the borough of Barking and Dagenham.

Task: Please provide a list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents
Violence Against the Person,count1:int
Theft and Handling,count2:int
Criminal Damage,count3:int
```

**Explanation:** This table lists the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category. The categories are ranked based on the total number of incidents reported..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'london_crime': ['crime_by_lsoa'], 'london_fire_brigade': ['fire_brigade_service_calls']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
