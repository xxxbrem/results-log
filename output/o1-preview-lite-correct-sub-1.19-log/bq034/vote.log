The correct SQL query is in the file:

```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Objective:** To find the IDs and names of weather stations within a 50 km straight-line distance from the center of Chicago (latitude 41.8319°, longitude -87.6847°).
- **Understanding the Function:**
  - The `ST_DISTANCE` function in BigQuery calculates the straight-line distance between two geographical points and returns the result in **meters**.
- **Analysis of Candidate SQL Queries:**

  1. **`0result.sql`:**
     ```sql
     SELECT `id`, `name`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ghcn_d.ghcnd_stations`
     WHERE ST_DISTANCE(ST_GEOGPOINT(`longitude`, `latitude`), ST_GEOGPOINT(-87.6847, 41.8319)) <= 500000;
     ```
     - **Distance Threshold:** 500,000 meters (500 km)
     - **Issue:** This query selects stations within 500 km of Chicago, which is much larger than the desired 50 km radius. This would include many stations outside the immediate vicinity of Chicago.

  2. **`1result.sql`:**
     ```sql
     SELECT
       id,
       name
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.ghcn_d.ghcnd_stations`
     WHERE
       ST_DISTANCE(
         ST_GEOGPOINT(longitude, latitude),
         ST_GEOGPOINT(-87.6847, 41.8319)
       ) <= 500001;
     ```
     - **Distance Threshold:** 500,001 meters (500.001 km)
     - **Issue:** Similar to the first query, this one uses a threshold that is ten times larger than required, leading to an overly broad selection of stations.

  3. **`2result.sql`:**
     ```sql
     SELECT `id`, `name`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ghcn_d.ghcnd_stations`
     WHERE ST_DISTANCE(ST_GEOGPOINT(`longitude`, `latitude`), ST_GEOGPOINT(-87.6847, 41.8319)) <= 50000;
     ```
     - **Distance Threshold:** 50,000 meters (50 km)
     - **Correctness:** This query correctly specifies the distance threshold as 50,000 meters, aligning with the objective of finding stations within a 50 km radius of Chicago's center.

- **Conclusion:**

  - **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query because it appropriately uses the distance threshold of 50,000 meters to select stations within 50 km of Chicago's center.
  - The other queries use a threshold of 500,000 meters or more, which is not aligned with the specified requirement.
