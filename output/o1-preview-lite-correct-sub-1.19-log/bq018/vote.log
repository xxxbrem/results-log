After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the most accurate and appropriate query to determine the day in March and April with the highest COVID-19 confirmed case growth rate in the United States. Here's why:

1. **Aggregation Level**:
   - `2result.sql` includes the condition `aggregation_level = 0`, which ensures that only national-level data is considered. This is crucial because the dataset may contain data at different aggregation levels (e.g., state, county), and we want to analyze the growth rate for the entire country.

2. **Data Completeness**:
   - It adds the condition `cumulative_confirmed IS NOT NULL` to filter out any records where the cumulative confirmed cases are missing. This prevents errors or inaccuracies in the growth rate calculation due to null values.

3. **Accurate Growth Rate Calculation**:
   - The query calculates the growth rate using the formula:
     ```sql
     SAFE_DIVIDE(cumulative_confirmed - LAG(cumulative_confirmed) OVER (ORDER BY date), LAG(cumulative_confirmed) OVER (ORDER BY date)) AS growth_rate
     ```
     This computes the day-over-day growth rate based on cumulative confirmed cases.

4. **Date Range and Country Filtering**:
   - It filters records for the United States within the specified date range (`'2020-03-01'` to `'2020-04-30'`) using `country_name = 'United States of America'`.

5. **Ordering and Limiting Results**:
   - By ordering the results in descending order of `growth_rate` and limiting to 1, it accurately identifies the date with the highest growth rate.

**Conclusion**:

The date with the highest COVID-19 confirmed case growth rate in the United States during March and April is **March 9th (`03-09`)**.
