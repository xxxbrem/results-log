**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

From `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`:
- **`station_id`**: Unique identifier for each station. Used to identify different stations.
- **`status`**: Indicates the current status of the station (e.g., 'Active', 'Closed'). Used to determine station status.
- **`modified_date`**: Timestamp of the last modification. Potentially used to infer when the status changed.
- **`name`**: Name of the station.

From `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`:
- **`start_station_id`**: ID of the station where a trip started. Helps identify active stations in a given year.
- **`end_station_id`**: ID of the station where a trip ended.
- **`start_time`**: Timestamp when the trip started. Used to filter trips by year.
- **`end_station_name`** and **`start_station_name`**: Names of the stations.

**Potential Conditions:**
- Filter trips by years 2013 and 2014 using `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time)`.
- Use `status` to identify if a station is 'Active' or 'Closed'.
- Join `bikeshare_stations` and `bikeshare_trips` on `station_id` and `start_station_id` or `end_station_id`.

These queries help understand the distribution of stations, their statuses, and their usage in the years 2013 and 2014. By analyzing the trips data and joining it with station information, we can infer which stations were active during those years based on whether they had any associated trips.Query:

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,status1:str,count1:int
2013,status2:str,count2:int
2014,status1:str,count3:int
2014,status2:str,count4:int
```

We provide the number of distinct bike share stations by their status for each of the years 2013 and 2014. The 'Status' represents the station status such as 'Active' or 'Closed', and 'Number_of_Stations' indicates the count of stations with that status in the given year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'austin_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'austin_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_stations', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'austin_crime': ['crime'], 'austin_incidents': ['incidents_2008', 'incidents_2009', 'incidents_2010', 'incidents_2011', 'incidents_2016'], 'austin_waste': ['waste_and_diversion']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 05:29:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,status1:str,count1:int
2013,status2:str,count2:int
2014,status1:str,count3:int
2014,status2:str,count4:int
```

We provide the number of distinct bike share stations by their status for each of the years 2013 and 2014. The 'Status' represents the station status such as 'Active' or 'Closed', and 'Number_of_Stations' indicates the count of stations with that status in the given year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
