This query retrieves the number of distinct bike share stations for each status ('Active' or 'Closed') in the years 2013 and 2014. It joins the `bikeshare_trips` table with the `bikeshare_stations` table on `station_id` and groups the results by trip year and station status.

**Note:** The `status` column in the `bikeshare_stations` table reflects the current status of the stations, not the status during 2013 or 2014. Since the `modified_date` does not provide historical status information for those years, this query assumes that the current status applies to past years, which may not accurately reflect the stations' statuses in 2013 and 2014.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task of providing the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we'll first identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions that can be used to extract the necessary information.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`

   - `station_id`: Used to uniquely identify each bike share station.
   - `status`: Indicates the status of the station (e.g., 'Active', 'Closed').
   - `modified_date`: The timestamp when the station's information was last modified.
   - `name`: Name of the station (useful for identification if needed).

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`

   - `start_station_id`: Identifies the station where a trip started.
   - `end_station_id`: Identifies the station where a trip ended.
   - `start_time`: Timestamp when the trip started, used to extract the year of the trip.
   - `end_time`: (Assuming it's present; used to extract the year if needed).

**Potential Usage and Conditions:**

- Use the `status` column to filter stations that are 'Active' or 'Closed'.
- Use `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date)` to determine the year when a station's status was modified.
- Use `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time)` in the trips table to find active stations based on usage in a particular year.
- Join `bikeshare_stations` and `bikeshare_trips` on `station_id` to correlate station status with trip data.
- Consider stations as 'active' in a year if they have recorded trips in that year.

**Sample SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

Below are simple, non-nested SQL queries to explore the data and understand the values in related columns.

1. **List all distinct station statuses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT status
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Count the total number of stations by status:**

   ```sql
   SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS station_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   GROUP BY status
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **View station IDs and their last modified dates:**

   ORDER BY trip_year
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Count the number of trips per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) AS trip_year, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   GROUP BY trip_year
   ORDER BY trip_year
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List stations that had trips in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT start_station_id
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2013
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **List stations that had trips in 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT start_station_id
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2014
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Count the number of stations with trips in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT start_station_id) AS station_count_2013
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2013;
   ```

10. **Count the number of stations with trips in 2014:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT start_station_id) AS station_count_2014
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2014;
    ```

11. **Get station statuses for stations modified in 2013:**

    ```sql
    SELECT station_id, status, modified_date
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) = 2013
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Get station statuses for stations modified in 2014:**

    ```sql
    SELECT station_id, status, modified_date
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) = 2014
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **View sample trip data from 2013:**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2013
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Count trips per station in 2013:**

    ```sql
    SELECT start_station_id, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2013
    GROUP BY start_station_id

    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

16. **List all station IDs and their statuses:**

    ```

18. **List stations that have never been used in trips:**

    ```sql
    SELECT station_id, status
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
    WHERE station_id NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT start_station_id FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
    )
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

19. **Get the number of stations added each year based on modified_date:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT subscriber_type
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries are designed to help understand the data related to bike share stations and trips during the years 2013 and 2014. By examining the station statuses, modification dates, and trip data, we can gain insights into the number of active and closed stations for each of those years.

**Note:** Since the `modified_date` in `bikeshare_stations` may not accurately reflect the station's status in previous years (it shows the last modification date), to determine the status of stations in 2013 and 2014, we might need to infer based on trip data. Stations that had trips in a specific year can be considered active during that year. However, this approach may not account for stations that were active but had no recorded trips.Query:

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,status1:str,count1:int
2013,status2:str,count2:int
2014,status1:str,count3:int
2014,status2:str,count4:int
```

We provide the number of distinct bike share stations by their status for each of the years 2013 and 2014. The 'Status' represents the station status such as 'Active' or 'Closed', and 'Number_of_Stations' indicates the count of stations with that status in the given year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'austin_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'austin_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_stations', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'austin_crime': ['crime'], 'austin_incidents': ['incidents_2008', 'incidents_2009', 'incidents_2010', 'incidents_2011', 'incidents_2016'], 'austin_waste': ['waste_and_diversion']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 05:32:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,status1:str,count1:int
2013,status2:str,count2:int
2014,status1:str,count3:int
2014,status2:str,count4:int
```

We provide the number of distinct bike share stations by their status for each of the years 2013 and 2014. The 'Status' represents the station status such as 'Active' or 'Closed', and 'Number_of_Stations' indicates the count of stations with that status in the given year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
