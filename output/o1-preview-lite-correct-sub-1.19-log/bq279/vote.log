After comparing the three SQL queries, I choose **2result.sql** as the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Data Type Consistency**: The query explicitly casts `start_station_id` to `INT64` to ensure it matches the data type of `station_id` in the `bikeshare_stations` table. This prevents any potential join issues due to data type mismatches.

2. **Status Case Handling**: By applying `LOWER(status)` in the `stations_with_status` CTE, the query standardizes the station statuses to lowercase. This ensures that any variations in the case (e.g., 'Active', 'active', 'ACTIVE') are handled uniformly during grouping and comparison.

3. **Improved Readability with CTEs**: Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for `trips` and `stations_with_status` makes the query more organized and easier to understand. It separates the logic for extracting trips and preparing station statuses, enhancing maintainability.

4. **Accurate Grouping and Counting**: The query correctly groups the data by `Year` and `Status` and counts the distinct `station_id`s, providing the required number of active and closed stations for each year.

**Note**: While all three queries produce the same result, **2result.sql** is more robust and less prone to errors due to the reasons mentioned above.
