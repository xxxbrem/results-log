Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
  - `station_id`: Used to uniquely identify each bike share station.
  - `status`: Indicates whether a station is 'Active' or 'Closed'. Potential usage: Determine the status of stations.
  - `modified_date`: Timestamp of when the station's details were last updated. Potential usage: Identify when the station's status might have changed.
  - `name`: Name of the station. Potential usage: For identification and display purposes.

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
  - `start_station_id`: ID of the station where a trip started.
  - `end_station_id`: ID of the station where a trip ended.
  - `start_time`: Timestamp when the trip started. Potential usage: Filter trips by year (2013 and 2014) to determine station activity during these years.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter trips occurring in the years 2013 and 2014 using the `start_time` column.
- Use `status` from `bikeshare_stations` to categorize stations as 'Active' or 'Closed'.
- Join `bikeshare_trips` and `bikeshare_stations` on `station_id` to relate trip data with station statuses.
- Use `modified_date` to understand any changes in station statuses.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct station statuses:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT status
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **List all stations with their statuses and modified dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT station_id, name, status, modified_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Find the range of station modification dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     MIN(modified_date) AS earliest_modified_date,
     MAX(modified_date) AS latest_modified_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`;
   ```

4. **Get the years for which trip data is available:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) AS trip_year
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Count trips per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) AS trip_year,
     COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   GROUP BY trip_year
   ORDER BY trip_year
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Count distinct stations used in trips for 2013 and 2014:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) AS trip_year,
     COUNT(DISTINCT start_station_id) AS number_of_stations
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) IN (2013, 2014)
   GROUP BY trip_year
   ORDER BY trip_year
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List stations with trips in 2013:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT start_station_id
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2013
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **List stations with trips in 2014:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT start_station_id
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2014
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Find stations modified in 2013:**
   ```sql
   SELECT station_id, name, status, modified_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) = 2013
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Find stations modified in 2014:**
    ```sql
    SELECT station_id, name, status, modified_date
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) = 2014
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Count stations by status:**
    ```sql
    SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS station_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
    GROUP BY status
    LIMIT 1000;

These queries aim to explore the data related to bike share stations and trips to understand station statuses and activity during the years 2013 and 2014. By examining these outputs, we can gather insights necessary to determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each of those years.Query:

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,status1:str,count1:int
2013,status2:str,count2:int
2014,status1:str,count3:int
2014,status2:str,count4:int
```

We provide the number of distinct bike share stations by their status for each of the years 2013 and 2014. The 'Status' represents the station status such as 'Active' or 'Closed', and 'Number_of_Stations' indicates the count of stations with that status in the given year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'austin_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'austin_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_stations', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'austin_crime': ['crime'], 'austin_incidents': ['incidents_2008', 'incidents_2009', 'incidents_2010', 'incidents_2011', 'incidents_2016'], 'austin_waste': ['waste_and_diversion']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 05:29:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,status1:str,count1:int
2013,status2:str,count2:int
2014,status1:str,count3:int
2014,status2:str,count4:int
```

We provide the number of distinct bike share stations by their status for each of the years 2013 and 2014. The 'Status' represents the station status such as 'Active' or 'Closed', and 'Number_of_Stations' indicates the count of stations with that status in the given year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
