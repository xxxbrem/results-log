**Consideration of Relevant Tables and Columns:**

**Tables:**

We are interested in the tables starting with the prefix `icoads_core` and covering the years between 2005 and 2015. The relevant tables are:

- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2006`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2007`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2008`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2011`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2012`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2013`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2014`
- `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2015`

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `year`: Used to filter data between 2005 and 2015.
- `month`: Combined with `year` and `day` to construct the date.
- `day`: Combined with `year` and `month` to construct the date.
- `latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the observation; used to identify the location.
- `longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the observation; used to identify the location.
- `wind_speed`: Wind speed value; necessary for calculating the average daily wind speed.
- `wind_speed_indicator`: May provide information about the method or units of the wind speed measurement.
- `timestamp`: Exact timestamp of the observation; can be used for precise date and time filtering.
- `platform_type`: Could be useful to understand the type of platform (e.g., ship, buoy) recording the data.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Exclude records where `wind_speed` is missing: `wind_speed IS NOT NULL`.
- Filter data for years between 2005 and 2015: `year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015`.
- Exclude records with invalid or missing latitude and longitude: `latitude IS NOT NULL AND longitude IS NOT NULL`.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct years in the dataset (should be between 2005 and 2015):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT year FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2005` LIMIT 1000
   ```

2. **Retrieve latitude, longitude, and wind_speed where wind_speed is not null (2006 data):**
   ```sql
   SELECT latitude, longitude, wind_speed FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2006` WHERE wind_speed IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000
   ```

3. **Select observations with the highest wind speeds in 2007:**
   ```sql
   SELECT latitude, longitude, wind_speed FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2007` WHERE wind_speed IS NOT NULL ORDER BY wind_speed DESC LIMIT 1000
   ```

4. **Find the count of records per year in 2008:**
   ```sql
   SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS record_count FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2008` GROUP BY year LIMIT 1000
   ```

5. **List distinct platform types in 2009:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT platform_type FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2009` LIMIT 1000
   ```

6. **Retrieve observations where wind_speed is greater than 50 (fast winds) in 2010:**
   ```sql
   SELECT latitude, longitude, wind_speed FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010` WHERE wind_speed IS NOT NULL AND wind_speed > 50 LIMIT 1000
   ```

7. **Select observations with missing wind_speed in 2011:**
   ```sql
   SELECT latitude, longitude, wind_speed FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2011` WHERE wind_speed IS NULL LIMIT 1000
   ```

8. **List wind_speed and corresponding air_temperature in 2012:**
   ```sql
   SELECT wind_speed, air_temperature FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2012` WHERE wind_speed IS NOT NULL AND air_temperature IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000
   ```

9. **Retrieve timestamps and wind_speed for observations in 2013:**
   ```sql
   SELECT timestamp, wind_speed FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2013` WHERE wind_speed IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000
   ```

10. **Select latitude, longitude, and date components in 2014:**
    ```sql
    SELECT latitude, longitude, year, month, day FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2014` WHERE wind_speed IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000
    ```

These queries help us explore the data by:

- Identifying the available years in the dataset.
- Checking for the presence of wind speed data and its distribution.
- Observing the maximum wind speeds recorded.
- Understanding the types of platforms collecting the data.
- Examining the relationships between wind speed and other variables like air temperature.
- Ensuring the availability and quality of latitude and longitude data.

By executing these queries, we can better understand the structure and contents of the datasets, which will aid in constructing the final query to answer the task.Query:

Task: What are the latitude and longitude coordinates and dates between 2005 and 2015 with the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds, excluding records with missing wind speed values? Using data from tables start with prefix "icoads_core".

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To find the latitude and longitude coordinates and dates between 2005 and 2015 with the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds, excluding records with missing wind speed values, we perform the following steps:

1. Use data from the tables starting with the prefix `icoads_core`, specifically from years 2005 to 2015.
2. Filter out records where the `wind_speed` value is missing.
3. Calculate the average wind speed for each unique combination of date and location (latitude and longitude).
4. Identify the top 5 date-location combinations with the highest average daily wind speeds.

The results are presented in the table below:

```csv
geom,date,avg_daily_wind_speed
POINT(longitude1 latitude1),date1,avg_wind_speed1:float >0
POINT(longitude2 latitude2),date2,avg_wind_speed2:float >0
POINT(longitude3 latitude3),date3,avg_wind_speed3:float >0
POINT(longitude4 latitude4),date4,avg_wind_speed4:float >0
POINT(longitude5 latitude5),date5,avg_wind_speed5:float >0
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 08:14:57 - root - INFO - To find the latitude and longitude coordinates and dates between 2005 and 2015 with the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds, excluding records with missing wind speed values, we perform the following steps:

1. **Use data from the tables starting with the prefix** `icoads_core`, **specifically from years 2005 to 2015**.
2. **Filter out records where the `wind_speed` value is missing or zero**.
3. **Calculate the average wind speed for each unique combination of date and location** (latitude and longitude).
4. **Identify the top 5 date-location combinations with the highest average daily wind speeds**.

The results are presented in the table below:

2025-01-19 08:15:06 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the latitude and longitude coordinates and dates between 2005 and 2015 with the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds, excluding records with missing wind speed values? Using data from tables start with prefix "icoads_core"., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the latitude and longitude coordinates and dates between 2005 and 2015 with the top 5 highest daily average wind speeds, excluding records with missing wind speed values, we perform the following steps:

1. Use data from the tables starting with the prefix `icoads_core`, specifically from years 2005 to 2015.
2. Filter out records where the `wind_speed` value is missing.
3. Calculate the average wind speed for each unique combination of date and location (latitude and longitude).
4. Identify the top 5 date-location combinations with the highest average daily wind speeds.

The results are presented in the table below:

```csv
geom,date,avg_daily_wind_speed
POINT(longitude1 latitude1),date1,avg_wind_speed1:float >0
POINT(longitude2 latitude2),date2,avg_wind_speed2:float >0

POINT(longitude4 latitude4),date4,avg_wind_speed4:float >0
POINT(longitude5 latitude5),date5,avg_wind_speed5:float >0
