Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_ID,Average_Units_Picked
product_id:int,average_units_picked:float
...
```

**Explanation:**

For order 421, we identified the products that were picked by querying the `picking_line` table where `order_id = 421`. To calculate the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we allocated the picked quantities from the earliest inventory batches. This involved matching the picked products to inventory records in the `inventory` table, ordering the inventory lots by their purchase dates (from the `purchases` table), and simulating the picking process starting from the oldest inventory. The average units picked for each product were then computed based on these FIFO allocations..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 11:47:08 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
