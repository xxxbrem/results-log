- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`
  - `report_year`: Used to select data between 2014 and 2023.
  - `workforce`: To filter for the overall workforce (e.g., `workforce = 'Overall'`).
  - `race_asian`: Percentage of Asians in the workforce.
  - `race_black`: Percentage of Black people in the workforce.
  - `race_hispanic_latinx`: Percentage of Latinx people in the workforce.
  - `race_native_american`: Percentage of Native Americans in the workforce.
  - `race_white`: Percentage of White people in the workforce.
  - `gender_us_women`: Percentage of U.S. women in the workforce.
  - `gender_us_men`: Percentage of U.S. men in the workforce.
  - `gender_global_women`: Percentage of global women in the workforce.
  - `gender_global_men`: Percentage of global men in the workforce.

**Conditions:**

- Filter data from years **2014** to **2023** (`report_year BETWEEN 2014 AND 2023`).
- Focus on the **overall workforce** (`workforce = 'Overall'`).

Task: Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Group,Growth_Rate
Asians,growth_rate:float
Black people,growth_rate:float
Latinx people,growth_rate:float
Native Americans,growth_rate:float
White people,growth_rate:float
US women,growth_rate:float
US men,growth_rate:float
Global women,growth_rate:float
Global men,growth_rate:float
(Attention: answer in this order)
```

To calculate the growth rates for the specified groups from 2014 to 2023 (as data for 2024 is not available), we would use the `dar_non_intersectional_representation` table in the `bigquery-public-data.google_dei` dataset. This table contains annual representation percentages for each group under the `report_year` column. The growth rate for each group is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Percentage in 2023} - \text{Percentage in 2014}}{\text{Percentage in 2014}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Since specific data values are not provided, we have indicated the expected data types for each growth rate as `float`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
