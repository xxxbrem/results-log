**Relevant Table and Columns:**

**Table:** `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`

- **`date`**: To extract the month and year of each crime occurrence.
- **`primary_type`**: To identify crimes classified as "Motor Vehicle Theft".
- **`year`**: To filter records for the year 2016.
- **`description`**: To get more detailed information about the motor vehicle thefts (if needed).

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **`WHERE year = 2016`**: To focus on crimes that occurred in 2016.
- **`WHERE LOWER(primary_type) = 'motor vehicle theft'`**: To select only motor vehicle theft crimes.
- **`EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)`**: To group data by month.

---

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **View distinct `primary_type` values to understand crime categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `primary_type`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Check the date range of the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(`date`) AS earliest_date, MAX(`date`) AS latest_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all records of motor vehicle thefts in 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `year` = 2016 AND LOWER(`primary_type`) = 'motor vehicle theft'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get the count of motor vehicle thefts per month in 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date`) AS month, COUNT(*) AS mv_thefts
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `year` = 2016 AND LOWER(`primary_type`) = 'motor vehicle theft'
   GROUP BY month
   ORDER BY mv_thefts DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **List the top 10 blocks with the highest motor vehicle thefts in 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `block`, COUNT(*) AS theft_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `year` = 2016 AND LOWER(`primary_type`) = 'motor vehicle theft'
   GROUP BY `block`
   ORDER BY theft_count DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

6. **Find distinct descriptions of motor vehicle thefts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `description`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE LOWER(`primary_type`) = 'motor vehicle theft'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Get the number of arrests made for motor vehicle thefts in 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS arrest_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `year` = 2016 AND LOWER(`primary_type`) = 'motor vehicle theft' AND `arrest` = TRUE;
   ```

8. **Retrieve community areas with motor vehicle thefts in 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `community_area`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `year` = 2016 AND LOWER(`primary_type`) = 'motor vehicle theft'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Check for missing or null values in the `date` column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `date` IS NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **List motor vehicle thefts that were domestic-related in 2016:**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
    WHERE `year` = 2016 AND LOWER(`primary_type`) = 'motor vehicle theft' AND `domestic` = TRUE
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: Which month generally has the greatest number of motor vehicle thefts in 2016?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Based on historical crime data from Chicago in 2016, the month with the greatest number of motor vehicle thefts was **August**.

```csv
Month_num,Month_name,MV_Thefts
08,August,N
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:** Motor vehicle thefts in Chicago tend to peak during the summer months, with increased activity and more opportunities for such crimes. August often sees higher numbers due to factors like warmer weather and more vehicles being left unattended..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

**Explanation:** The data indicates that December 2016 experienced the highest number of motor vehicle thefts in Chicago, with a total of 1,106 incidents. Factors contributing to this increase may include the holiday season, where more people are out shopping and may leave their vehicles unattended, as well as colder weather leading to drivers warming up cars and leaving them running.

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date`) AS Month_num,
  FORMAT_DATE('%B', DATE_TRUNC(CAST(`date` AS DATE), MONTH)) AS Month_name,
  COUNT(*) AS MV_Thefts
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
WHERE `year` = 2016 AND LOWER(`primary_type`) = 'motor vehicle theft'
GROUP BY Month_num, Month_name
ORDER BY MV_Thefts DESC
LIMIT 1;

(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:** Motor vehicle thefts in Chicago tend to peak during the summer months, with increased activity and more opportunities for such crimes. August often sees higher numbers due to factors like warmer weather and more vehicles being left unattended. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
