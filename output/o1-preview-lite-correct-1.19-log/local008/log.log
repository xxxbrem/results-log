Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant tables and columns:**

- `"batting"."player_id"`: Used to identify players and join with the `"player"` table.
- `"batting"."g"`: Number of games played by a player in a given stint/year.
- `"batting"."r"`: Number of runs scored by a player in a given stint/year.
- `"batting"."h"`: Number of hits by a player in a given stint/year.
- `"batting"."hr"`: Number of home runs by a player in a given stint/year.
- `"player"."player_id"`: To join with the `"batting"` table.
- `"player"."name_given"`: The given name of the player.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Summing the statistics over all years and stints to get career totals per player.
- Grouping by `"player_id"` to aggregate data per player.
- Ordering results to find players with the highest totals.
- Joining the `"batting"` and `"player"` tables on `"player_id"` to get player names.

**Sample SQL queries:**

```sql
-- 1. List distinct player IDs from the batting table
SELECT DISTINCT "player_id" FROM "batting" LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. Retrieve player IDs and their given names from the player table
SELECT "player_id", "name_given" FROM "player" LIMIT 1000;

-- 3. List player IDs and total games played
SELECT "player_id", SUM("g") AS "total_games"
FROM "batting"
GROUP BY "player_id"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 4. List player IDs and total runs scored
SELECT "player_id", SUM("r") AS "total_runs"
FROM "batting"
GROUP BY "player_id"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. List player IDs and total hits
SELECT "player_id", SUM("h") AS "total_hits"
FROM "batting"
GROUP BY "player_id"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 6. List player IDs and total home runs
SELECT "player_id", SUM("hr") AS "total_home_runs"
FROM "batting"
GROUP BY "player_id"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 7. Get player IDs, total games played, and given names
SELECT b."player_id", SUM(b."g") AS "total_games", p."name_given"
FROM "batting" AS b
JOIN "player" AS p ON b."player_id" = p."player_id"
GROUP BY b."player_id"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 8. Find the top 10 players with the highest total games played
SELECT b."player_id", SUM(b."g") AS "total_games"
FROM "batting" AS b
GROUP BY b."player_id"
ORDER BY "total_games" DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 9. Find the top 10 players with the highest total runs scored
SELECT b."player_id", SUM(b."r") AS "total_runs"
FROM "batting" AS b
GROUP BY b."player_id"
ORDER BY "total_runs" DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 10. Find the top 10 players with the highest total hits
SELECT b."player_id", SUM(b."h") AS "total_hits"
FROM "batting" AS b
GROUP BY b."player_id"
ORDER BY "total_hits" DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 11. Find the top 10 players with the highest total home runs
SELECT b."player_id", SUM(b."hr") AS "total_home_runs"
FROM "batting" AS b
GROUP BY b."player_id"
ORDER BY "total_home_runs" DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 12. List all given names from the player table
SELECT DISTINCT "name_given" FROM "player" LIMIT 1000;

-- 13. Get player IDs and their total games played where games played is greater than 1000
SELECT "player_id", SUM("g") AS "total_games"
FROM "batting"
GROUP BY "player_id"
HAVING SUM("g") > 1000
LIMIT 1000;

-- 14. Get player IDs and the maximum games played in a single year
SELECT "player_id", MAX("g") AS "max_games_in_a_year"
FROM "batting"
GROUP BY "player_id"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 15. Get player IDs and total runs scored, ordering by player ID
SELECT "player_id", SUM("r") AS "total_runs"
FROM "batting"
GROUP BY "player_id"
ORDER BY "player_id" ASC
LIMIT 1000;
```

These queries will help in understanding the values in the related columns and how they can be used to identify the players with the highest totals in games played, runs, hits, and home runs.Query:

Task: I would like to know the given names of baseball players who have achieved the highest value of games played, runs, hits, and home runs, with their corresponding score values.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Stat,Given_Name,Score
Games Played,player_name1:str,score1:int
Runs,player_name2:str,score2:int
Hits,player_name3:str,score3:int
Home Runs,player_name4:str,score4:int
```
This table lists the given names of baseball players who have achieved the highest values in Games Played, Runs, Hits, and Home Runs, along with their corresponding score values..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 02:58:41 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I would like to know the given names of baseball players who have achieved the highest value of games played, runs, hits, and home runs, with their corresponding score values., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Stat,Given_Name,Score
Games Played,player_name1:str,score1:int
Runs,player_name2:str,score2:int
Hits,player_name3:str,score3:int
Home Runs,player_name4:str,score4:int
```
This table lists the given names of baseball players who have achieved the highest values in Games Played, Runs, Hits, and Home Runs, along with their corresponding score values. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
