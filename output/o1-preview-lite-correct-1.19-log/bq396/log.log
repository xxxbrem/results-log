2025-01-19 08:51:23 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion earlier. It appears that the column `day_of_week_name` does not exist in the `accident_2016` table of the `nhtsa_traffic_fatalities` dataset. Instead, we have the `day_of_week` column, which contains numeric codes representing the days of the week.

Similarly, the column `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` may not be present. We can use the numeric `atmospheric_conditions_1` column, which uses codes to represent different weather conditions.

**Here is how we can proceed:**

### **Understanding the Available Columns:**

**Relevant Table:**

- `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `state_name`: Identifies the state where each accident occurred; used to group accidents by state.
- `day_of_week`: Numeric code representing the day of the week (1=Sunday, 2=Monday, ..., 7=Saturday); used to filter accidents occurring on weekends.
- `atmospheric_conditions_1`: Numeric code representing the atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash; used to identify 'Rain' and 'Clear' weather conditions.
- `consecutive_number`: Unique identifier for each accident; used to count the number of accidents.

**Conditions:**

- **Weekends:** `day_of_week` IN (1, 7)
- **Clear Weather:** `atmospheric_conditions_1` = 1
- **Rainy Weather:** `atmospheric_conditions_1` = 2

**Note:** The atmospheric condition codes are as follows (based on FARS documentation):

- **1:** Clear
- **2:** Rain
- **3:** Sleet, Hail
- **4:** Snow
- **5:** Fog, Smog, Smoke
- **...** (Other codes represent other conditions)

### **Adjusted SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List distinct `day_of_week` values:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `day_of_week`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

2. **Map `day_of_week` codes to day names:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `day_of_week`,
    CASE `day_of_week`
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Sunday'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Monday'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
        WHEN 5 THEN 'Thursday'
        WHEN 6 THEN 'Friday'
        WHEN 7 THEN 'Saturday'
    END AS `day_name`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

3. **List distinct `atmospheric_conditions_1` values:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `atmospheric_conditions_1`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

4. **Map `atmospheric_conditions_1` codes to weather conditions:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `atmospheric_conditions_1`,
    CASE `atmospheric_conditions_1`
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Clear'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Rain'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Sleet, Hail'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Snow'
        WHEN 5 THEN 'Fog, Smog, Smoke'
        -- Add other mappings as needed
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS `weather_condition`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

5. **Retrieve accidents on weekends:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `consecutive_number`, `state_name`, `day_of_week`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7)
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

6. **Retrieve accidents on weekends during clear weather:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `consecutive_number`, `state_name`, `day_of_week`, `atmospheric_conditions_1`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) AND `atmospheric_conditions_1` = 1
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

7. **Retrieve accidents on weekends during rainy weather:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `consecutive_number`, `state_name`, `day_of_week`, `atmospheric_conditions_1`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) AND `atmospheric_conditions_1` = 2
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

8. **List all atmospheric conditions recorded during weekends:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `atmospheric_conditions_1`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7)
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

9. **Count accidents by state for clear weather on weekends:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `state_name`, COUNT(*) AS accidents_clear
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) AND `atmospheric_conditions_1` = 1
    GROUP BY `state_name`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

10. **Count accidents by state for rainy weather on weekends:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `state_name`, COUNT(*) AS accidents_rain
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) AND `atmospheric_conditions_1` = 2
    GROUP BY `state_name`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

### **Explanation:**

- **Mapping Codes to Descriptions:** Since the dataset uses numeric codes, we can map these codes to their descriptions using the `CASE` statement in SQL. This allows us to interpret the data effectively.

- **Filtering Data:**
  - **Weekends:** We filter the data where `day_of_week` is 1 (Sunday) or 7 (Saturday).
  - **Weather Conditions:** We filter the data for `atmospheric_conditions_1` codes corresponding to 'Clear' (1) and 'Rain' (2).

- **Aggregating Data:**
  - We count the number of accidents for each state under different weather conditions during weekends.
  - This helps us calculate the differences in the number of accidents between rainy and clear weather.

### **Next Steps:**

- **Calculating Differences:**

  To identify the top 3 states with the largest differences in the number of accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends, we would perform a calculation on the counts obtained from queries 9 and 10.

- **Final Query (Example):**

  While we were instructed not to use nested queries or joins in the previous step, to fulfill the task, we would use a query like the following:

  ```sql
  SELECT
    clear.state_name,
    ABS(clear.accidents_clear - rain.accidents_rain) AS accident_difference
  FROM
    (
      SELECT `state_name`, COUNT(*) AS accidents_clear
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
      WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) AND `atmospheric_conditions_1` = 1
      GROUP BY `state_name`
    ) AS clear
  JOIN
    (
      SELECT `state_name`, COUNT(*) AS accidents_rain
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
      WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) AND `atmospheric_conditions_1` = 2
      GROUP BY `state_name`
    ) AS rain
  ON clear.state_name = rain.state_name
  ORDER BY accident_difference DESC
  LIMIT 3;
  ```

  This query calculates the absolute difference in the number of accidents between clear and rainy weather for each state during weekends and returns the top 3 states with the largest differences.

### **Conclusion:**

By adjusting our approach to use the available columns and codes in the dataset, we can effectively perform the analysis required to answer the task. Again, I apologize for any confusion caused earlier and hope this clarifies how to proceed with the data.

**SQL Queries to Understand Values in Related Columns:**

1. **List distinct state names:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `state_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

2. **List distinct days of the week:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `day_of_week`, `day_of_week_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

3. **List distinct atmospheric conditions:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `atmospheric_conditions_1`, `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

4. **Retrieve accidents that occurred on weekends:**
    ```sql
    SELECT `consecutive_number`, `state_name`, `day_of_week`, `day_of_week_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

5. **Retrieve accidents in clear weather conditions:**
    ```sql
    SELECT `consecutive_number`, `state_name`, `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    WHERE `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` = 'Clear' 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

6. **Retrieve accidents in rainy weather conditions:**
    ```sql
    SELECT `consecutive_number`, `state_name`, `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    WHERE `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` = 'Rain' 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

7. **Retrieve weekend accidents during clear weather:**
    ```sql
    SELECT `consecutive_number`, `state_name`, `day_of_week_name`, `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) AND `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` = 'Clear' 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

8. **Retrieve weekend accidents during rainy weather:**
    ```sql
    SELECT `consecutive_number`, `state_name`, `day_of_week_name`, `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) AND `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` = 'Rain' 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

9. **List all atmospheric conditions recorded during weekends:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    WHERE `day_of_week` IN (1, 7) 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

10. **Retrieve accidents with both primary and secondary atmospheric conditions:**
    ```sql
    SELECT `consecutive_number`, `state_name`, `atmospheric_conditions_1_name`, `atmospheric_conditions_2_name` 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` 
    WHERE `atmospheric_conditions_2_name` IS NOT NULL 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: Which top 3 states had the largest differences in the number of traffic accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends in 2016? Please also provide the respective differences for each state.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top 3 states with the largest differences in the number of traffic accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends in 2016, we used the `accident_2016` table from the `nhtsa_traffic_fatalities` dataset. We filtered the data to include only accidents that occurred on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) by selecting records where the `day_of_week` is 1 (Sunday) or 7 (Saturday). We then counted the number of accidents for each state under 'Rainy' and 'Clear' conditions by examining the `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` field. After calculating the absolute differences between these counts for each state, we identified the top 3 states with the largest differences.

```csv
State,Accident_Difference
state1:str,difference1:int
state2:str,difference2:int
state3:str,difference3:int
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 08:53:20 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which top 3 states had the largest differences in the number of traffic accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends in 2016? Please also provide the respective differences for each state., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the top 3 states with the largest differences in the number of traffic accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends in 2016, we used the `accident_2016` table from the `nhtsa_traffic_fatalities` dataset. We filtered the data to include only accidents that occurred on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) by selecting records where the `day_of_week` is 1 (Sunday) or 7 (Saturday).

```csv
State,Accident_Difference
state1:str,difference1:int
state2:str,difference2:int
state3:str,difference3:int
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
