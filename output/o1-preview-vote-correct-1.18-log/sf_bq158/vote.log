After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries and their corresponding results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

- **Direct and Efficient Calculation**: The query in `0result.sql` directly calculates the percentage of CDH1 mutations for each histological type by performing a `LEFT JOIN` between the clinical and mutation data. This approach efficiently includes all BRCA patients and correctly accounts for those without CDH1 mutations.

- **Proper Filtering of Data**:
  - It filters the clinical data to include only breast cancer (BRCA) patients using `c."acronym" = 'BRCA'`.
  - It excludes null or empty histological types with `c."histological_type" IS NOT NULL` and `c."histological_type" != ''`.
  - In the mutation data, it focuses on CDH1 gene mutations specific to BRCA patients with `m."Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDH1'` and `m."Study" = 'BRCA'`.

- **Accurate Calculation of Percentages**: By counting the distinct patient barcodes from both the clinical and mutation data, the query accurately computes the percentage of patients with CDH1 mutations for each histological type.

- **Comprehensive Result Set**: The use of `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all histological types are included in the results, even if there are no CDH1 mutations observed in some types.

Therefore, the correct SQL query that answers the task is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
