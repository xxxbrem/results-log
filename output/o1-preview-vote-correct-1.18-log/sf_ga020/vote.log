The SQL script in `1result.sql` is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

The task is to identify the quickplay event type with the lowest user retention rate during the second week after users' initial engagement, specifically for users who first engaged between August 1 and August 15, 2018.

The SQL in `1result.sql` accurately addresses this task for the following reasons:

1. **Extracting Quickplay Event Types from `event_params`:**
   - This query dives into the `event_params` column to extract the `quickplay_event_type` by targeting the `board` parameter within the event parameters.
   - By doing this, it captures the specific types of quickplay events (e.g., 'S', 'M', 'L') that users engaged with, providing a granular analysis of event types.

2. **Aligning with the Definition of Event Types:**
   - The quickplay event type, as intended in the task, refers to the variations or categories within quickplay events, which are specified in the `event_params`.
   - The first SQL (`0result.sql`) uses the `event_name` as the event type, which only differentiates between events at a higher level (e.g., `level_start_quickplay`, `level_end_quickplay`) and does not capture the specific event types within quickplay activities.

3. **Calculating Retention Based on User Engagements:**
   - The query calculates the retention rate by identifying users who engaged with a specific quickplay event type on their first day and then returned to engage with the same event type during the second week (days 8 to 14 after initial engagement).
   - This method accurately reflects user retention for each specific quickplay event type.

4. **Results Reflecting the Lowest Retention Rate:**
   - The result indicates that the quickplay event type 'M' had the lowest second-week retention rate of 8.33%.
   - This aligns with the task's requirement to find the event type with the lowest retention rate.

Therefore, `1result.sql` provides a precise and detailed answer to the question by correctly identifying and analyzing quickplay event types based on the `event_params`, thus pinpointing the event type with the lowest user retention rate.
