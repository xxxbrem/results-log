After reviewing both SQL queries, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct choice. Both queries accurately compute the net difference between the number of PAAD patients with mutations in both **KRAS** and **TP53** genes and those without mutations in either gene, resulting in a net difference of **40**. However, `2result.sql` is more concise and straightforward, making it clearer and more efficient.
