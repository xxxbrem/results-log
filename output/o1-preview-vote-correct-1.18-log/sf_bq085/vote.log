After reviewing both SQL queries, **`0result.sql`** is the correct one. It accurately maps the country names between the COVID-19 data and the population data, ensuring that the calculations for cases per 100,000 people are correct. It handles the country name discrepancies (like mapping 'US' to 'United States' and 'Iran, Islamic Rep.' to 'Iran') within the subqueries and outputs, leading to precise and coherent results.
