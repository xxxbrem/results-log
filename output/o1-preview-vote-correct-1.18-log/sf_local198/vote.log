The correct SQL is:

```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reason:**

The SQL query in `2result.sql` accurately addresses the task by:

1. **Identifying Countries with More Than 4 Customers:** It uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) `qualifying_countries` to select countries where the number of customers exceeds four.

2. **Calculating Total Sales per Country:** Another CTE `total_sales_per_country` joins the `CUSTOMERS` and `INVOICES` tables to sum the total sales for each qualifying country.

3. **Computing the Median Value:** The final SELECT statement computes the median of the total sales using `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY "TotalSales")`, providing a precise median value of total sales among the selected countries.

The use of CTEs enhances the readability and organization of the query, making it clear and maintainable. Additionally, `2result.sql` includes the `ROUND` function to format the median total sales to four decimal places, which adds clarity to the result.
