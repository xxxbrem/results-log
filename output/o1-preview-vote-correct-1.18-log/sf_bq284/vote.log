I choose **1result.sql** as the correct answer.

**Reason:** Both SQL queries produce the same results, but **1result.sql** uses a clearer and more concise syntax. It directly multiplies by `100.0` to compute the percentage without the need for casting to `FLOAT`, making the calculation more straightforward and easier to understand.
