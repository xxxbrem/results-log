External knowledge that might be helpful: 
None
The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'BBC': {'BBC_NEWS': ['FULLTEXT']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Let's consider the relevant columns and their potential usage:

- **"category"**: Used to group articles into different categories.
- **"body"**: Contains the full text of the article; can be searched for the word "education" to find articles that mention it.
- **"title"**: Contains the title of the article; can also be searched for the word "education".
- **"filename"**: May contain identifying information about the article; potentially useful for referencing.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Searching for articles where **"body"** or **"title"** contains the word **"education"** using case-insensitive matching.
- Grouping articles by **"category"** to get counts and percentages.

Below are 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

```sql
-- 1. Retrieve distinct categories
SELECT DISTINCT "category"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. Count the total number of articles
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Articles"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
LIMIT 1000;

-- 3. Count the number of articles per category
SELECT "category", COUNT(*) AS "Article_Count"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
GROUP BY "category"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 4. Find articles that mention 'education' in the body
SELECT "category", "title", "filename"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. Count the number of articles mentioning 'education' per category
SELECT "category", COUNT(*) AS "Education_Articles"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%'
GROUP BY "category"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 6. Retrieve distinct titles that mention 'education'
SELECT DISTINCT "title"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 7. Find the total number of articles mentioning 'education'
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Education_Articles"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 8. List filenames of articles mentioning 'education'
SELECT "filename"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 9. Get sample articles from each category
SELECT "category", "title"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
GROUP BY "category", "title"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 10. Check for articles with empty body
SELECT "category", "title"
FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
WHERE "body" IS NULL OR "body" = ''
LIMIT 1000;
```

These queries help understand the distribution of articles across categories, identify how often "education" is mentioned, and explore other relevant aspects of the dataset.Query:

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Here is a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_with_Education
category1:str,total1:int,percentage1:float in [0,100]
category2:str,total2:int,percentage2:float in [0,100]
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'BBC': {'BBC_NEWS': ['FULLTEXT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 05:25:35 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Here is a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_with_Education
category1:str,total1:int,percentage1:float in [0,100]
category2:str,total2:int,percentage2:float in [0,100]
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
