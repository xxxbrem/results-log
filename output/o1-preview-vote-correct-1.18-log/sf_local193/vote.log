After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that the correct answer is:

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Time Calculations:** The query in `1result.sql` correctly calculates the time differences in seconds between the first purchase date and subsequent payment dates using `TIMESTAMPDIFF('second', ...)`. This aligns with the requirement to base the 7- and 30-day periods on the exact number of hours, minutes, and seconds.

- **Proper Date Conversion:** It uses `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ` with the specific format `'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3'` to accurately convert the `"payment_date"` strings into timestamp objects suitable for precise time calculations.

- **Excludes Customers with Zero Lifetime Sales:** The query filters out customers with zero total lifetime sales by including the condition `WHERE "total_ltv" > 0`, as specified in the task.

- **Clear Calculation Steps:** The SQL is structured in a way that clearly defines each step:
  - Calculates the total lifetime sales (LTV) and the first purchase date per customer.
  - Joins payments with the LTV data.
  - Aggregates the amounts within the first 7 and 30 days based on precise time differences.
  - Computes the average LTV and percentage contributions for the specified periods.

- **Consistent Results:** The results from `1result.sql` match those from the other queries (`0result.sql` and `2result.sql`), but the method used in `1result.sql` is more precise and aligns better with the requirements.

**Conclusion:**

The SQL query in `1result.sql` best fulfills all the requirements of the task by accurately calculating the average percentage of total lifetime sales occurring in the first 7 and 30 days after a customer's initial purchase, based on exact time intervals.
