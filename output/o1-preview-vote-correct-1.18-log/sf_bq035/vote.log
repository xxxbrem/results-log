After comparing both SQL queries, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for calculating the total distance traveled by each bike.

**Reason:**

- **Correct Use of Haversine Formula:** The query in `0result.sql` correctly applies the Haversine formula to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth's surface. The formula used is:

  ```
  distance = 2 * 6371 * ASIN(
    SQRT(
      SIN^2((latitude_end - latitude_start) / 2) +
      COS(latitude_start) * COS(latitude_end) * SIN^2((longitude_end - longitude_start) / 2)
    )
  )
  ```
  
  This formula calculates the shortest distance over the earthâ€™s surface, giving an accurate representation of the distance traveled between stations.

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The query in `0result.sql` computes the distance directly within the `SUM` aggregation without unnecessary subqueries or complexity. This enhances readability and may improve execution performance.

- **Proper Grouping and Ordering:** The query correctly groups the results by `bike_number` and orders them in ascending order, which aligns with the requirement to calculate the total distance traveled by each bike.

- **Data Validity Checks:** The query includes conditions to ensure that all latitude and longitude values are not null, ensuring the accuracy of the distance calculations.

In contrast, while `2result.sql` also aims to calculate the distance using a form of the Haversine formula, it introduces extra complexity by using an inner subquery and the `ATAN2` function. Although mathematically equivalent, this adds unnecessary complexity without providing additional benefits over the straightforward approach used in `0result.sql`.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**

```plain
0result.sql
