After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL statement to use. Here's why:

**Comparison of SQL Queries:**

1. **Grouping Criteria:**
   - **`0result.sql`:**
     - Groups by `p."player_name"`, `b."match_id"`, and `b."over_id"`.
     - **Missing `innings_no` in the `GROUP BY` clause.**
   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - Groups by `t4."player_name"`, `t1."match_id"`, `t1."innings_no"`, and `t1."over_id"`.
     - **Includes `innings_no` in the `GROUP BY` clause.**

2. **Reason for Correctness:**
   - **Importance of `innings_no`:**
     - In cricket, a match consists of multiple innings (usually two).
     - Overs are numbered starting from 1 in each innings.
     - Without including `innings_no` in the grouping, overs from different innings but with the same `over_id` will be combined incorrectly.
   - **`0result.sql` Issue:**
     - By not including `innings_no`, it may aggregate runs from overs in different innings with the same `over_id`.
     - This can lead to inflated run counts for a single over.
   - **`2result.sql` Correctness:**
     - By grouping on `innings_no` as well, it ensures that only deliveries from the same innings and over are aggregated.
     - This provides accurate run totals per over per innings.

3. **Consistency with Data Structure:**
   - Both `BALL_BY_BALL`, `BATSMAN_SCORED`, and `EXTRA_RUNS` tables contain `innings_no` as a key component.
   - Properly joining and grouping on `innings_no` aligns with the data's relational structure.

4. **Results Verification:**
   - Both queries return the same top 3 bowlers and matches with identical run counts, which suggests that in this specific case, the missing `innings_no` didn't affect the outcome.
   - However, for data integrity and to prevent potential errors in other cases, including `innings_no` is essential.

**Conclusion:**

- **`2result.sql`** is the correct query because it accurately groups the data by `match_id`, `innings_no`, `over_id`, and `bowler`, ensuring precise calculation of runs conceded in each over for a given innings.
- It adheres to best practices for relational data queries and prevents the misaggregation of data across different innings.
