Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant columns and their potential usage:**

- **"country_code"**: To filter records for US patents.
- **"kind_code"**: To filter records for B2 patents.
- **"publication_date"**: To filter patents granted between 2008 and 2018.
- **"claims_localized"**: To check if the claims do not include the word 'claim'.
- **"publication_number"**: To identify specific patents.
- **"claims_localized"** (VARIANT): May need to flatten to access individual claims.

**Sample SQL queries to understand the data:**

Task: How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Patents
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims not including the word 'claim', we would query the `PUBLICATIONS` table, filtering by `country_code = 'US'`, `kind_code = 'B2'`, and `publication_date` between 20080101 and 20181231. We would then check the `claims_localized` field for claims that do not contain the word 'claim'..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant columns and their potential usage:**

- **"country_code"**: To filter records for US patents.
- **"kind_code"**: To filter records for B2 patents.
- **"publication_date"**: To filter patents granted between 2008 and 2018.
- **"claims_localized"**: To check if the claims do not include the word 'claim'.
- **"publication_number"**: To identify specific patents.
- **"claims_localized"** (VARIANT): May need to flatten to access individual claims.

**Sample SQL queries to understand the data:**

```sql
-- 1. Retrieve distinct country codes in the PUBLICATIONS table.
SELECT DISTINCT "country_code"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. Retrieve distinct kind codes in the PUBLICATIONS table.

SELECT MIN("publication_date") AS "Earliest_Publication", MAX("publication_date") AS "Latest_Publication"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US';

-- 4. Count the total number of US B2 patents.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_US_B2_Patents"

  AND f.value::STRING NOT ILIKE '%claim%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 10. Count the number of unique patents with at least one claim not containing 'claim'.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t."publication_number") AS "Patents_With_Claims_Without_Claim_Word"

Task: How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Patents
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims not including the word 'claim', we would query the `PUBLICATIONS` table, filtering by `country_code = 'US'`, `kind_code = 'B2'`, and `publication_date` between 20080101 and 20181231. We would then check the `claims_localized` field for claims that do not contain the word 'claim'..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Task: How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Patents
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims not including the word 'claim', we would query the `PUBLICATIONS` table, filtering by `country_code = 'US'`, `kind_code = 'B2'`, and `publication_date` between 20080101 and 20181231. We would then check the `claims_localized` field for claims that do not contain the word 'claim'..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
