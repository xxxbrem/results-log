The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
The relevant table for this task is `PUBLICATIONS` in the `PATENTS` database and schema. The following columns are pertinent to the task:

- `"country_code"`: Used to filter for US patents.
- `"kind_code"`: Used to filter for patents with kind code 'B2'.
- `"grant_date"`: Used to select patents granted between 2008 and 2018.
- `"claims_localized"`: Contains the claims text to check for the absence of the word 'claim'.
- `"publication_number"`: Identifies individual patents.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `WHERE "country_code" = 'US'`
- `WHERE "kind_code" = 'B2'`
- `WHERE "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231`
- `WHERE "claims_localized" IS NOT NULL`

To explore the data and understand the values in the related columns, here are 10 simple SQL queries:

```sql
-- 1. Get distinct country codes in the PUBLICATIONS table.
SELECT DISTINCT "country_code" FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. Get distinct kind codes for US patents.
SELECT DISTINCT "kind_code" FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' LIMIT 1000;

-- 3. Retrieve minimum and maximum grant dates for US patents.
SELECT MIN("grant_date"), MAX("grant_date") FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "grant_date" IS NOT NULL;

-- 4. List publication numbers and grant dates for US B2 patents.
SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date" FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. Get sample claims_localized data for US patents.
SELECT "publication_number", "claims_localized" FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "claims_localized" IS NOT NULL LIMIT 10;

-- 6. Extract claim texts from claims_localized for a specific patent.
SELECT t."publication_number", f.value::STRING AS "claim_text"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
WHERE t."publication_number" = 'US1234567B2';

-- 7. List publication numbers of US patents granted between 2008 and 2018.
SELECT "publication_number" FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231 LIMIT 1000;

-- 8. Get the count of US B2 patents granted each year between 2008 and 2018.
SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_DATE("grant_date", 'YYYYMMDD')) AS "year", COUNT(*) FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
GROUP BY "year" ORDER BY "year";

-- 9. View claims_localized structure for US B2 patents.
SELECT t."publication_number", t."claims_localized" FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
WHERE t."country_code" = 'US' AND t."kind_code" = 'B2' LIMIT 10;

-- 10. Extract the first claim text for US B2 patents.
SELECT t."publication_number", f.value::STRING AS "first_claim_text"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized", outer => TRUE) f
WHERE t."country_code" = 'US' AND t."kind_code" = 'B2' AND f.index = 0 LIMIT 10;
```

Task: How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Patents
number:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims not including the word 'claim', we would count the records in the `PUBLICATIONS` table where the `country_code` is 'US', the `kind_code` is 'B2', the `grant_date` falls within the specified range, and the `claims_localized` field does not contain the word 'claim'..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
