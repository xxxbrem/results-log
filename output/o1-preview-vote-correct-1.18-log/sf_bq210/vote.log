After comparing the SQL queries, the correct query is `0result.sql`.

**Reason:**

- The task is to find the **number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'**, meaning patents that have **at least one claim that does not contain 'claim'**.

- The query in `0result.sql` accurately captures this by:
  - Filtering for US B2 patents with `publication_date` between 20080101 and 20181231.
    - For US B2 patents, the `publication_date` corresponds to the grant date.
  - Using `LATERAL FLATTEN` to access individual claims.
  - Selecting patents where **at least one claim does not include 'claim'** (`f.value::STRING NOT ILIKE '%claim%'`).
  - Counting the **distinct publication numbers** of these patents.

- The other queries (`1result.sql` and `2result.sql`) count patents where **none of the claims include 'claim'**. This is not what the task requires.

**Therefore, the correct SQL file is:**

```plain
0result.sql
```
