Upon comparing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Correct Month Formatting:** The SQL script in `2result.sql` correctly formats the month names into readable strings like 'November 2020', 'December 2020', and 'January 2021'. This aligns with the requirement to identify monthly data.

- **Accurate Calculation:** The query accurately identifies customers who purchased the 'Google Red Speckled Tee' and calculates the most purchased other products and their quantities for each of the specified months.

- **Expected Output:** The results in `2result.csv` show the most purchased other products and their total quantities by these customers for each month, matching the task requirements.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
