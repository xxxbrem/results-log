After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Calculation of Base Price:**
   - The query correctly assigns the base price of $12 for 'Meatlovers' and $10 for 'Vegetarian' pizzas using the `CASE` statement:
     ```sql
     CASE
       WHEN pn."pizza_name" = 'Meatlovers' THEN 12
       WHEN pn."pizza_name" = 'Vegetarian' THEN 10
       ELSE 0
     END AS base_price
     ```
   - This ensures that only the specified pizzas are considered, with correct pricing.

2. **Proper Counting of Extra Toppings:**
   - It calculates the number of extra toppings using `REGEXP_COUNT(pc."extras", ',') + 1`, which accurately counts the number of commas in the "extras" string and adds 1 to get the total extras:
     ```sql
     CASE
       WHEN pc."extras" IS NULL OR pc."extras" = '' THEN 0
       ELSE REGEXP_COUNT(pc."extras", ',') + 1
     END AS num_extras
     ```
   - This method accounts for multiple extra toppings and handles cases where the "extras" field is NULL or empty.

3. **Exclusion of Canceled Orders:**
   - The query excludes canceled orders by checking if the "cancellation" field is NULL or empty:
     ```sql
     WHERE pr."cancellation" IS NULL OR pr."cancellation" = ''
     ```
   - This ensures that only completed orders contribute to the total income.

4. **Comprehensive Joins and Data Inclusion:**
   - The query joins the `PIZZA_CUSTOMER_ORDERS`, `PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS`, and `PIZZA_NAMES` tables, ensuring all necessary data is included.
   - It does not rely on any cleaned versions of the tables, making it applicable to the provided dataset.

5. **Clarity and Precision:**
   - The use of an inner subquery improves readability by separating the calculation logic from the aggregation.
   - The explicit casting to `DECIMAL(10,4)` provides precision in the output.
