Upon reviewing the three SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have concluded that **Option 1 (`1result.sql`)** is the correct SQL query that accurately addresses the task.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Objective:** We need to find the names of strikers who scored **no less than 100 runs** in a match, but whose team **lost** the game.

2. **Key Requirements:**
   - Calculate the total runs scored by each striker in each match.
   - Identify the team the striker was playing for in that specific match.
   - Determine if their team lost the match.

3. **Comparison of SQL Queries:**

   - **Option 0 (`0result.sql`):**
     - Uses the `BALL_BY_BALL`'s `"team_batting"` column to determine the striker's team.
     - While `"team_batting"` generally represents the batting team, it might not always reliably represent the striker's team due to data anomalies or edge cases.
   
   - **Option 1 (`1result.sql`):**
     - Calculates total runs per striker per match.
     - Joins the `PLAYER_MATCH` table to accurately determine the striker's team (`pm."team_id"`).
     - Compares the striker's team with the `match_winner` to check if the team lost.
     - This method ensures that the team association is accurate for each player in the specific match, as it accounts for cases where a player might have changed teams during the tournament.

   - **Option 2 (`2result.sql`):**
     - Similar to Option 0, it uses `"team_batting"` from the `BALL_BY_BALL` table to identify the striker's team.
     - Faces the same potential issues as Option 0 regarding the accuracy of the team association.

4. **Conclusion:**

   - **Option 1** provides a more reliable approach by using the `PLAYER_MATCH` table to determine the striker's team in each match.
   - This ensures that we accurately identify players who scored 100 or more runs in a match but whose team did not win.
