After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL for the task. This query calculates the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method by considering the inventory batches based on their purchase dates. It incorporates the FIFO logic into the calculation, which aligns with the task's requirement.
