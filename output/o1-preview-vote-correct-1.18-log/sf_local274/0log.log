Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine which tables and columns are relevant to the task, we'll consider the following:

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **ORDERS**
  - `"id"`: Order ID (condition: `"id" = 421` to find order 421)
  - `"customer_id"`: Customer who placed the order
  - `"ordered"`: Date when the order was placed
  - `"delivery"`: Delivery date

- **ORDERLINES**
  - `"order_id"`: Links to `"ORDERS"."id"` (condition: `"order_id" = 421` to find lines for order 421)
  - `"product_id"`: Products included in the order
  - `"qty"`: Quantity of each product ordered
  - `"amount"`: Total amount for each line item

- **PICKING_LINE**
  - `"order_id"`: Links to `"ORDERS"."id"` (condition: `"order_id" = 421` to find picking lines for order 421)
  - `"product_id"`: Products picked for the order
  - `"qty"`: Quantity picked per product
  - `"picklist_id"`: Identifier for the picking list
  - `"line_no"`: Line number in the picking list
  - `"location_id"`: Location from which the product was picked

- **INVENTORY**
  - `"product_id"`: Products available in inventory
  - `"purchase_id"`: Links to `"PURCHASES"."id"`
  - `"qty"`: Quantity available from a specific purchase batch
  - `"location_id"`: Location of the inventory

- **PURCHASES**
  - `"id"`: Purchase ID (links to `"INVENTORY"."purchase_id"`)
  - `"product_id"`: Products purchased (used to replenish inventory)
  - `"qty"`: Quantity purchased
  - `"purchased"`: Date when the purchase was made (used for FIFO)

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter by `"order_id" = 421` to focus on the specific order.
- Use `"product_id"` to identify products involved.
- Order by `"purchased"` date to implement FIFO logic.

Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
product_id,average_units_picked
product_id1:int,average_units_picked1:float
product_id2:int,average_units_picked2:float
...
```

The table above lists the products picked for order 421 and the average number of units picked for each product, calculated using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 16:00:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
product_id,average_units_picked
product_id1:int,average_units_picked1:float
product_id2:int,average_units_picked2:float
...
```

The table above lists the products picked for order 421 and the average number of units picked for each product, calculated using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
