After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query that fulfills all the specified conditions is in:

```plain
2result.sql
```

I chose `2result.sql` because it accurately selects the objects from the 'Photographs' department with 'Photograph' in their names, excludes unknown artists, filters objects with an end date of 1839 or earlier, and retrieves the original image URLs by joining with the IMAGES table.
