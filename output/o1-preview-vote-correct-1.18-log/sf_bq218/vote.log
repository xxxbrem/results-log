After comparing both SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is **`2result.sql`**.

**Reason:**

- **Efficiency:** `2result.sql` computes the growth percentage directly within a single query without the need for additional Common Table Expressions (CTEs). This makes it more efficient and concise.
- **Clarity:** Using CASE statements within aggregate functions allows for a clear and direct calculation of the total sales for each year and the subsequent growth percentage.
- **Performance:** By avoiding joins and multiple subqueries, `2result.sql` may perform better, especially on large datasets.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
