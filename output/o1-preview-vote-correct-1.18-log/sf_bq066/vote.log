After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct choice. This SQL query accurately calculates the total number of births by using the `COUNTY_NATALITY` table, ensuring that all births are counted. It then correctly computes the number of births without maternal morbidity from the `COUNTY_NATALITY_BY_MATERNAL_MORBIDITY` table where `"Maternal_Morbidity_YN" = 0`. 

Additionally, `0result.sql` appropriately joins the natality data with the poverty rates from the previous year's census data, matching on the county FIPS codes extracted from the rightmost five digits of the `"geo_id"` field. This alignment ensures that the poverty rates correspond to the correct counties and years, fulfilling the requirement to use the 5-year census data from the year before.

The other SQL queries either use the maternal morbidity table to calculate total births—potentially missing births categorized as unknown—or may calculate poverty rates using incorrect denominators. Therefore, `0result.sql` provides the most accurate and reliable assessment of the relationship between poverty rates and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity.
