After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have chosen **0result.sql** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Precision in Tag Filtering:** The query in `0result.sql` specifically filters for tags that match any of the following: 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', or 'android'. This aligns precisely with the specified tags in the task, ensuring that only questions related to these Android development topics are considered.
  
- **Compliance with Requirements:** The task asks for the most viewed "how" question related to Android development across specified tags. Although both queries returned the same result, `0result.sql` explicitly includes the specified tags, making it more accurate and aligned with the task's requirements.

**Conclusion:**

- **Selected SQL File:**

```plain
0result.sql
```
