After reviewing the three candidate SQL queries, I have determined that all three queries aim to find the names of the two wrestlers involved in the shortest NXT title match (excluding matches with a title change). Each query successfully retrieves the correct result: **Bron Breakker** (Winner) and **Duke Hudson** (Loser).

**Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

- **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**
  - Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the query into logical steps:
    - **`nxt_titles`**: Retrieves the IDs of all belts with 'NXT' in the name.
    - **`valid_matches`**: Filters matches for those involving NXT titles, without title changes, and with valid durations. Calculates the duration in seconds for comparison.
    - **`shortest_match`**: Selects the match with the shortest duration.
  - Joins the result with the `WRESTLERS` table to get the names of the winner and loser.
  - The query is well-organized, readable, and efficiently computes the required result.

- **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**
  - Similar to Candidate 0 but uses `TRY_TO_NUMBER` for data conversion, which may not be necessary if the data format is consistent.
  - Includes additional conditions to ensure that the split parts of the duration are numeric.
  - While it is thorough, it introduces complexity without significant benefits over Candidate 0.

- **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**
  - Performs direct joins between `MATCHES`, `BELTS`, and `WRESTLERS`.
  - Filters matches based on conditions similar to the previous candidates.
  - Orders the results by duration and match ID.
  - This query is straightforward but less modular compared to Candidate 0.

**Reason for Choosing Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**

Candidate 0's SQL query is the most efficient and well-structured among the three options. By using CTEs, it breaks down the problem into manageable parts, enhancing readability and maintainability. It also directly addresses the task by:

- Selecting relevant NXT titles.
- Filtering matches without title changes and with valid durations.
- Calculating the duration in seconds for accurate comparison.
- Finding the shortest match.
- Retrieving the names of the wrestlers involved.

**Therefore, `0result.sql` is the correct and preferred SQL query.**
