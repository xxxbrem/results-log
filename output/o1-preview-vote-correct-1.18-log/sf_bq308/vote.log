After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**
   - **Issue with Day Mapping:** The query uses `EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM ...)` to get the day of the week and maps numbers to day names using a `CASE` statement. However, the `EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM ...)` function can return different values depending on the SQL dialect:
     - In some databases, `DAYOFWEEK` returns 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, ..., 7 for Saturday.
     - In others, it may start with Monday as 1.
   - **Incorrect Day Names and Counts:** The mismatched counts and incorrect mapping of day numbers to day names result in inconsistent data. For example, "Friday" shows a question count that doesn't align with other candidates.
   - **Blank Day Name:** There's a blank day name in the results, indicating an error in the `CASE` mapping or data extraction.

2. **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**
   - **Use of Day Names:** The query uses `TO_VARCHAR(..., 'Dy')` to extract abbreviated day names like "Mon", "Tue", etc., which is appropriate.
   - **Slight Discrepancies in Counts:** While the percentages are similar to Candidate 0, there are slight differences in the number of questions per day. For instance, the question counts for "Fri" and "Sun" differ from Candidate 0.
   - **Formatting and Functions:** The query is generally correct but may have minor inconsistencies due to formatting or function differences.

3. **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**
   - **Accurate Date Conversion:** The query correctly converts the `creation_date` from microseconds to a timestamp using `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("creation_date" / 1000000)`.
   - **Consistent Day Mapping:** It uses `DAYOFWEEKISO` and `DAYNAME` functions, which adhere to the ISO standard, ensuring that Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7. This results in accurate day names and counts.
   - **Correct Time Difference Calculation:** The calculation for determining if an answer was provided within one hour is correctly implemented by comparing the creation dates of the question and its first answer.
   - **Logical Results:** The counts and percentages are consistent and make logical sense. The ordering of days is correct, and the data aligns with expectations.

**Conclusion:**

Candidate 0 provides the most accurate and reliable results due to correct day mapping, accurate calculations, and logical data alignment. Therefore, it is the correct SQL query to use for the task.
