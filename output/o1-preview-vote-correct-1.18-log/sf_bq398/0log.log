**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `INTERNATIONAL_DEBT` (from `WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT` schema)
   - `"country_name"`: To identify records for Russia.
   - `"country_code"`: To confirm Russia's country code.
   - `"indicator_name"`: To retrieve the names of debt indicators.
   - `"indicator_code"`: To get the codes corresponding to each indicator.
   - `"value"`: Used to determine the debt values.
   - `"year"`: To consider the debt values over different years.

2. **Table:** `SERIES_SUMMARY` (from `WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT` schema)
   - `"series_code"`: To get detailed information about each indicator.
   - `"indicator_name"`: To fetch the names of debt indicators.
   - `"short_definition"`: Provides a brief description of the indicator.

3. **Conditions that may be used:**

   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.INTERNATIONAL_DEBT
   WHERE "country_name" = 'Russian Federation';
   ```

3. **List all debt-related indicator names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "indicator_name"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.INTERNATIONAL_DEBT
   WHERE "indicator_name" ILIKE '%debt%';
   ```

4. **Fetch all debt-related indicator codes and names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "indicator_code", "indicator_name"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.INTERNATIONAL_DEBT
   WHERE "indicator_name" ILIKE '%debt%';
   ```

5. **Get all debt records for Russia:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.INTERNATIONAL_DEBT
   WHERE "country_name" = 'Russian Federation' AND "indicator_name" ILIKE '%debt%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Find the maximum debt value for each indicator for Russia:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "indicator_name", MAX("value") AS "max_value"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.INTERNATIONAL_DEBT
   WHERE "country_name" = 'Russian Federation' AND "indicator_name" ILIKE '%debt%'
   GROUP BY "indicator_name"
   ORDER BY "max_value" DESC;
   ```

7. **Retrieve the most recent debt values for Russia:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "indicator_name", "value", "year"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.INTERNATIONAL_DEBT
   WHERE "country_name" = 'Russian Federation' AND "indicator_name" ILIKE '%debt%'
   ORDER BY "year" DESC, "value" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **List available years for debt data for Russia:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.INTERNATIONAL_DEBT
   WHERE "country_name" = 'Russian Federation' AND "indicator_name" ILIKE '%debt%';
   ```

9. **Get definitions of debt indicators:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "series_code", "indicator_name", "short_definition"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.SERIES_SUMMARY
   WHERE "indicator_name" ILIKE '%debt%';
   ```

10. **Check the debt values for Russia in a specific year (e.g., most recent year):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "indicator_name", "value"
    FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.INTERNATIONAL_DEBT
    WHERE "country_name" = 'Russian Federation' AND "indicator_name" ILIKE '%debt%' AND "year" = 2019
    ORDER BY "value" DESC;
    ```

Task: What are the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the debt indicators for Russia, the top three indicators with the highest debt values are:

```csv
indicator_name,value
indicator_name1:str,value1:float
indicator_name2:str,value2:float
indicator_name3:str,value3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

These indicators represent the highest recorded debt metrics for Russia..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'WORLD_BANK': {'WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION': ['POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY'], 'WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_DEBT', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_EDUCATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_EDUCATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY'], 'WORLD_BANK_WDI': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'FOOTNOTES', 'INDICATORS_DATA', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIME']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
