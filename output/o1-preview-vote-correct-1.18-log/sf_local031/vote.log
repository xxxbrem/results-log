The correct SQL query is `2result.sql`.

**Reason:**

- **Dynamic Determination of the Lowest Year:** Unlike `0result.sql`, which hardcodes the year `2016`, `2result.sql` dynamically determines the year with the lowest annual delivered orders volume among 2016, 2017, and 2018. This approach ensures that the query remains correct even if the data changes in the future.

- **Correct Implementation of the Task Requirements:**
  - **Step 1:** It calculates the total delivered orders for each year (2016, 2017, 2018).
  - **Step 2:** It identifies the year with the lowest annual delivered orders volume.
  - **Step 3:** It computes the delivered orders per month for that lowest year.
  - **Step 4:** It finds the highest monthly delivered orders volume within that year.

- **Robustness and Flexibility:** By not hardcoding any specific year, `2result.sql` is more robust and adaptable to data changes, ensuring accurate results regardless of fluctuations in the dataset.

Therefore, `2result.sql` is the correct and preferred query as it fully addresses the task requirements in a dynamic and reliable manner.

Here is the name of the correct SQL file:
