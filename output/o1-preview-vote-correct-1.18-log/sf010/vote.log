After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Avoiding Double-Counting:** The first SQL query focuses solely on the variables for the **"All Mortgages"** category. This category already encompasses all mortgage types in California, ensuring that each mortgage is counted only once.

- **Accurate Representation:** By selecting variables with `"VARIABLE_NAME"` corresponding to the **"All Mortgages"** market segment, the query accurately calculates the cumulative percentages without overlapping data from different market segments.

- **Second SQL Issue:** The second SQL query (`2result.sql`) includes variables from all market segments by filtering on `"VARIABLE_GROUP"`. Since mortgages can belong to multiple segments (e.g., a mortgage might be counted in both "Enterprise Acquisitions" and "Government / Non-Conventional"), summing across these segments can lead to **double-counting**, resulting in inflated cumulative percentages.

- **Alignment with Task Objective:** The task seeks the cumulative percentage of mortgages near default **for the entire market in California**. Using the **"All Mortgages"** category directly addresses this by providing an aggregate without duplication.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** provides the correct cumulative percentages for mortgages near default in California for each recorded date in 2023.
