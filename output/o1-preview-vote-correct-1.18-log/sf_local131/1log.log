Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Consideration of Relevant Tables and Columns:**

**Tables:**

1. **`MUSICAL_STYLES`**

   - **Columns:**
     - `"StyleID"`: Unique identifier for each musical style.
       - *Potential usage*: To join with `MUSICAL_PREFERENCES` to get the style associated with each preference.
     - `"StyleName"`: Name of the musical style.
       - *Potential usage*: To display the name of the style in the final results.

2. **`MUSICAL_PREFERENCES`**

   - **Columns:**
     - `"CustomerID"`: Unique identifier for each customer.
       - *Potential usage*: Could be used if we need to count preferences per customer (not directly needed here).
     - `"StyleID"`: Identifier of the musical style preferred by the customer.
       - *Potential usage*: To count how many times each style is preferred.
     - `"PreferenceSeq"`: The order of preference (1 for first preference, 2 for second, etc.).
       - *Potential usage*: To filter and count preferences that are 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Join Condition**: Joining `MUSICAL_PREFERENCES` with `MUSICAL_STYLES` on `"StyleID"` to get the style names.
- **Filter Condition**: Filtering `"PreferenceSeq"` to 1, 2, or 3 to focus on top three preferences.
- **Grouping**: Grouping by `"StyleID"` and `"PreferenceSeq"` to count occurrences.
- **Limit**: Using `LIMIT 1000` to limit the number of rows in queries where appropriate.

Each of these queries helps in understanding the data:

1. **Query 1 & 2**: Identify all musical styles available by IDs and Names.
2. **Query 3**: See which styles have been chosen by customers.
3. **Query 4**: Understand the range of preference sequence values.
4. **Query 5**: Find out how many times each style has been preferred in total.
5. **Query 6**: See how many preferences exist for each preference order.
6. **Query 7**: Retrieve all first preference records.
7. **Query 8**: Count how many times each style is a first preference.
8. **Query 9**: Map StyleIDs to StyleNames.
9. **Query 10**: Get total preference counts for each style name.

These queries lay the groundwork for analyzing how often each musical style appears as a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference, by exploring and understanding the data in the relevant tables and columns.Query:

Task: Could you list each musical style with the number of times it appears as a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference in a single row per style?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To list each musical style with the number of times it appears as a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference, we consider the `MUSICAL_STYLES` and `MUSICAL_PREFERENCES` tables. The `MUSICAL_PREFERENCES` table records customer preferences for musical styles, with `PreferenceSeq` indicating the preference order (1 for first preference, 2 for second, and so on).

Here is the requested information in CSV format:

```csv
StyleName,FirstPreferenceCount,SecondPreferenceCount,ThirdPreferenceCount
style_name1:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int
style_name2:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **StyleName**: The name of the musical style.
- **FirstPreferenceCount**: Number of times the style is selected as the first preference.
- **SecondPreferenceCount**: Number of times the style is selected as the second preference.
- **ThirdPreferenceCount**: Number of times the style is selected as the third preference.

Each row represents a musical style and the counts of how often it appears as a customer's 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ENTERTAINMENTAGENCY': {'ENTERTAINMENTAGENCY': ['AGENTS', 'CUSTOMERS', 'ENGAGEMENTS', 'ENTERTAINERS', 'ENTERTAINER_MEMBERS', 'ENTERTAINER_STYLES', 'MEMBERS', 'MUSICAL_PREFERENCES', 'MUSICAL_STYLES', 'ZTBLDAYS', 'ZTBLMONTHS', 'ZTBLSKIPLABELS', 'ZTBLWEEKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 14:48:23 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you list each musical style with the number of times it appears as a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference in a single row per style?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To list each musical style with the number of times it appears as a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference, we consider the `MUSICAL_STYLES` and `MUSICAL_PREFERENCES` tables. The `MUSICAL_PREFERENCES` table records customer preferences for musical styles, with `PreferenceSeq` indicating the preference order (1 for first preference, 2 for second, and so on).

Here is the requested information in CSV format:

```csv
StyleName,FirstPreferenceCount,SecondPreferenceCount,ThirdPreferenceCount
style_name1:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int
style_name2:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **StyleName**: The name of the musical style.
- **FirstPreferenceCount**: Number of times the style is selected as the first preference.
- **SecondPreferenceCount**: Number of times the style is selected as the second preference.
- **ThirdPreferenceCount**: Number of times the style is selected as the third preference.

Each row represents a musical style and the counts of how often it appears as a customer's 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
