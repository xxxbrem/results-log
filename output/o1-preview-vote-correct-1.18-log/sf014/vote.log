After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that both queries correctly identify ZIP code **11236** as the New York State ZIP code with the highest number of commuters traveling over one hour, with a total of **18,945.09** commuters. The state benchmark for commuters traveling over one hour is **1,518,460.0**, and the state population is **20,114,745**.

However, I choose `2result.sql` as the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Efficiency and Readability**: The query in `2result.sql` is more straightforward. It calculates the total commuters over one hour for each ZIP code and orders the results directly in the final `SELECT` statement using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`. This reduces the number of intermediate steps and makes the query easier to read and maintain.

2. **Clear Labeling**: The columns in `2result.sql` are clearly labeled, enhancing the readability of both the query and the resulting dataset. This clarity is beneficial for anyone who needs to understand or modify the query in the future.

3. **Consistency**: The query uses consistent aliasing and formatting, which adheres to best practices in SQL writing.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
