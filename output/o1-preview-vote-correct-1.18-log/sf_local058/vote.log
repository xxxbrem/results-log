After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **Option 1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Task Requirement:** Provide a list of hardware product segments along with their unique product counts for 2020 in the output, ordered by the highest percentage increase in unique fact sales products from 2020 to 2021.

- **Option 1result.sql:**
  - **SQL Logic:**
    - Calculates the unique product counts for each segment for the years 2020 and 2021.
    - Computes the percentage increase from 2020 to 2021.
    - Orders the output by the highest percentage increase.
    - **Outputs only the segment and unique product counts for 2020**, as required.
  - **Results:**
    - Provides the segments with their unique product counts for 2020.
    - The list is ordered by the highest percentage increase from 2020 to 2021.

- **Options 0result.sql and 2result.sql:**
  - Both include the percentage increase in the output, which is **not required** as per the task.
  - The task specifies to include only the segments and their unique product counts for 2020 in the output.

Therefore, **Option 1result.sql** aligns perfectly with the task requirements by providing the necessary output and ordering, without including extra data.
