After comparing the two SQL queries provided, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer for identifying the hubs that saw more than a 20% increase in finished orders from February to March.

### **Reasoning:**

1. **Simplicity and Clarity:**

   - **`2result.sql`** uses a straightforward approach by directly computing the number of finished orders for each hub in February and March separately and then calculating the percentage increase.
   - It employs two subqueries (`feb_orders` and `mar_orders`) that are easy to understand and maintain.

2. **Efficiency:**

   - **`2result.sql`** avoids unnecessary complexity by not using additional Common Table Expressions (CTEs) beyond the necessary subqueries.
   - This can lead to better performance, especially on large datasets, as it reduces the computational overhead.

3. **Direct Alignment with the Task:**

   - The query directly filters hubs where the percentage increase is greater than 20%, aligning precisely with the task's requirements.
   - It ensures that only those hubs meeting the specified condition are returned in the result.

4. **Same Accurate Results:**

   - Both queries produce the same list of hubs, indicating that they are functionally equivalent in terms of output.
   - However, **`2result.sql`** achieves this with a more concise and efficient query.
