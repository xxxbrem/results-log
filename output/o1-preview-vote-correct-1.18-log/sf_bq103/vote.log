After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`)** appears to provide the correct calculations for the required summary statistics. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Number of Variants and Allele Counts:**
   - Both **Candidate 0** and **Candidate 1** report the same number of variants (**5,604**), total allele count (**7,917,038**), and total number of alleles (**790,936,430**).
   - **Candidate 2** reports significantly higher values, which suggests it may include additional data outside the specified region or there might be an error in the query logic.

2. **Density of Mutations:**
   - **Candidate 1** calculates the density of mutations as approximately **4.5335**, which is correct when computed as:
     \[
     \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Length of Region}}{\text{Number of Variants}} = \frac{55,064,852 - 55,039,447 + 1}{5,604} \approx 4.5335
     \]
   - **Candidate 0** reports a density of **0.2206**, which seems to be the inverse of the correct calculation, indicating that it divided the number of variants by the length of the region instead.

3. **Correctness and Clarity of the SQL Query:**
   - **Candidate 1's SQL** is clear, correctly aggregates the necessary data, and computes each statistic accurately.
   - It also properly handles the extraction and aggregation of gene symbols using `LISTAGG` with appropriate conditions to exclude null or empty values.

4. **Consistency of Results:**
   - The results from **Candidate 1** are consistent with expected values based on the specified genomic region and the known size of the data.

Therefore, **Candidate 1's SQL (`1result.sql`)** is the correct answer.
