After comparing both SQL queries, the correct SQL query that accurately computes the percentage of trees in the Bronx with a health status of "Good" is:

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Focus on Alive Trees:**
  - The `1result.sql` query includes the condition `"status" = 'Alive'`, ensuring that only living trees are considered. Health status is only meaningful for trees that are alive.
  - The `0result.sql` query does not filter out dead or stump trees, which could skew the results since dead trees cannot have a health status of "Good".

- **Excluding Unknown Health Status:**
  - `1result.sql` includes the conditions `"health" IS NOT NULL` and `"health" != ''` to exclude trees with unknown or missing health statuses from the calculation.
  - `0result.sql` filters `health` to be in `('Good', 'Fair', 'Poor')`, but may still include records with missing health status if not handled properly.

- **Accurate Denominator:**
  - By considering only alive trees with known health statuses, `1result.sql` provides an accurate denominator for calculating the percentage.
  - `0result.sql` might include trees without valid health information in the denominator, leading to an inaccurate calculation.

Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct query as it appropriately filters the dataset to include only relevant trees for the calculation, resulting in an accurate percentage of trees in the Bronx that have a health status of "Good".
