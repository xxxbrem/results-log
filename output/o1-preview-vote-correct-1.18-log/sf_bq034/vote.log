After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Correct Implementation of the Haversine Formula**: It accurately calculates the straight-line (great-circle) distance between the stations and Chicago's center using the Haversine formula.

2. **Validity Checks for Coordinates**: It explicitly checks that both `"latitude"` and `"longitude"` are not null, ensuring the calculation is only performed on records with valid coordinate data.

3. **Accurate and Efficient Calculation**: The query uses the `ASIN` function, which is numerically stable and commonly used for distance calculations on spheres.

4. **Appropriate Radius and Units**: The query uses the Earth's radius in kilometers (6371 km) and filters stations within a 50 km radius, aligning with the task requirements.

Here is the correct SQL filename:

```plain
1result.sql
```
