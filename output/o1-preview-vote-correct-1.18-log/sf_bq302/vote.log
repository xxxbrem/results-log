After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- The query in **`1result.sql`** directly extracts the month and year from the `"creation_date"` field using `TO_CHAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("creation_date" / 1000000), 'MM')` and `TO_CHAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("creation_date" / 1000000), 'YYYY')`.
- It filters the data for the year **2022** and calculates the monthly proportion of questions tagged with `'python'` in a straightforward manner.
- The query avoids the use of subqueries, making it simpler and more efficient while still producing accurate results that match those in the provided CSV.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
