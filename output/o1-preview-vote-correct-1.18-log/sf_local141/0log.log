Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **SALESPERSON**
   - **"businessentityid"**: Identifies each salesperson; can be used to link sales data with salesperson information.

2. **SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY**
   - **"BusinessEntityID"**: Identifies the salesperson; matches with **"businessentityid"** in the SALESPERSON table.
   - **"QuotaDate"**: The date when the sales quota was assigned; the year can be extracted for annual comparison.
   - **"SalesQuota"**: The assigned sales quota amount for the salesperson; used for comparison with actual sales.

3. **SALESORDERHEADER**
   - **"salespersonid"**: Identifies the salesperson associated with each sales order; may need type conversion to match **"businessentityid"**.
   - **"orderdate"**: The date of the sales order; the year can be extracted to aggregate annual sales.
   - **"totaldue"**: The total amount due for the sales order; used to calculate total sales per salesperson.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Matching salesperson IDs between tables (e.g., **"BusinessEntityID"** and **"salespersonid"**).
- Extracting the year from dates (**"QuotaDate"** and **"orderdate"**) for grouping.
- Summing **"totaldue"** to calculate annual total sales per salesperson.
- Calculating the difference between **"SalesQuota"** and total sales.

**SQL Queries:**

   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESPERSON
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. ```sql

Task: How did each salesperson's annual total sales compare to their annual sales quota? Provide the difference between their total sales and the quota for each year, organized by salesperson and year.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
SalesPersonID,Year,SalesQuota,TotalSales,Difference
id1:int,year1:int,quota1:float,sales1:float,difference1:float
id2:int,year2:int,quota2:float,sales2:float,difference2:float
...
```

This table shows the difference between each salesperson's annual total sales and their annual sales quota, organized by salesperson and year. The `Difference` column is calculated as `TotalSales` minus `SalesQuota`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ADVENTUREWORKS': {'ADVENTUREWORKS': ['COUNTRYREGIONCURRENCY', 'CURRENCYRATE', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCTCATEGORY', 'PRODUCTDESCRIPTION', 'PRODUCTMODELPRODUCTDESCRIPTIONCULTURE', 'PRODUCTREVIEW', 'PRODUCTSUBCATEGORY', 'SALESORDERDETAIL', 'SALESORDERHEADER', 'SALESPERSON', 'SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY', 'SALESTERRITORY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 14:52:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How did each salesperson's annual total sales compare to their annual sales quota? Provide the difference between their total sales and the quota for each year, organized by salesperson and year., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
SalesPersonID,Year,SalesQuota,TotalSales,Difference
id1:int,year1:int,quota1:float,sales1:float,difference1:float
id2:int,year2:int,quota2:float,sales2:float,difference2:float
...
```

This table shows the difference between each salesperson's annual total sales and their annual sales quota, organized by salesperson and year. The `Difference` column is calculated as `TotalSales` minus `SalesQuota`. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
