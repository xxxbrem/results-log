After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Inclusiveness of All Teams**: The `1result.sql` script starts by selecting all teams from the `TEAM` table and uses **LEFT JOINs** to include the home and away win counts. This approach ensures that **all teams** are considered in the final result, even those with zero wins. 

- **Handling Teams with Zero Wins**: By using `COALESCE(hw."home_wins", 0)` and `COALESCE(aw."away_wins", 0)`, the script replaces `NULL` values (which would occur if a team has no home or away wins) with `0`. This accurately reflects teams with zero wins rather than excluding them or causing calculation errors.

- **Correct Calculation of Total Wins**: The script accurately sums the home and away wins for each team, providing a correct total win count.

- **Consistent Results**: The output results match across all scripts; however, `1result.sql` ensures correctness by accounting for all teams and correctly handling teams with zero wins.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**

```plain
1result.sql
