After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct query.

**Reason:**

Both queries aim to calculate the average scores for each board type from the quick play mode completions on September 15, 2018. However, **`1result.sql`** handles the extraction and conversion of the score values more robustly:

- **Score Extraction:**
  - **`1result.sql`** uses the `TRY_TO_NUMBER` function combined with `COALESCE` to handle different possible data types (`string_value`, `int_value`, `double_value`) that the `value` field might contain. This ensures that all score values are correctly converted to a numeric format, regardless of how they are stored.
  - **`0result.sql`** only attempts to extract the score from the `int_value` field. If any scores are stored as `double_value` or `string_value`, they would be missed, potentially leading to inaccurate averages.

- **Data Grouping:**
  - **`1result.sql`** groups the data by both `event_timestamp` and `user_pseudo_id`. This reduces the chance of aggregating unrelated events that might have the same timestamp but belong to different users.
  - **`0result.sql`** groups only by `event_timestamp`, which might combine events from different users if they occur at the same time, possibly skewing the results.

**Conclusion:**

Given its comprehensive handling of score data and more precise grouping, **`1result.sql`** provides a more accurate calculation of the average scores for each board type.
