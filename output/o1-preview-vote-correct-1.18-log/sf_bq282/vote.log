After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **`0result.sql`** filters the bike share trips to include only those involving **active stations** by checking the `"status" = 'active'` in the `active_stations` Common Table Expression (CTE). This aligns with the task's requirement to consider only active council districts.
- It ensures that both the start and end stations are active and have valid numeric `"station_id"` and `"council_district"` values.
- By using `TRY_TO_NUMBER` on station IDs and council districts, it avoids errors due to non-numeric or null values.
- The query accurately counts the number of trips that start and end within the same active council district but at different stations.

On the other hand, **`2result.sql`** does not filter for active stations. It includes all stations regardless of their status, which may lead to counting trips involving inactive stations or districts not currently in use.

Therefore, the correct SQL query that meets the task's requirements is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
