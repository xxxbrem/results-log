After reviewing the SQL queries and their results:

- **Option 0** has an error in the last query where `t.rn = 10` instead of `t.rn = 1`, leading to incorrect results for the Home Runs statistic.
  
- **Option 2** includes both the given names and last names, whereas your task specifies the **given names** of the players.

**Option 1** correctly:

- Retrieves the given names of the players (including middle names) who have achieved the highest values in games played, runs, hits, and home runs.
- Calculates the total statistics accurately using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
- Presents the results clearly with the corresponding score values.

Therefore, **Option 1** (`1result.sql`) is the correct SQL query that fulfills your requirements.
