The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure, let's first identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential usages:

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

- **`F1.F1.RESULTS`**
  - `"driver_id"`: Identifies the driver in each race result.
  - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies the constructor in each race result.
  - `"race_id"`: Links the result to a specific race.
  - `"points"`: Points earned by the driver in the race.

- **`F1.F1.RACES`**
  - `"race_id"`: Unique identifier for each race.
  - `"year"`: The year the race took place.

- **`F1.F1.DRIVERS`**
  - `"driver_id"`: Unique identifier for each driver.
  - `"full_name"`: Full name of the driver.

- **`F1.F1.CONSTRUCTORS`**
  - `"constructor_id"`: Unique identifier for each constructor.
  - `"name"`: Name of the constructor.

### Conditions and Joins that May Be Used:

- **Join `RESULTS` and `RACES`** on `"race_id"` to associate results with the race year.
- **Join `RESULTS` and `DRIVERS`** on `"driver_id"` to get driver names.
- **Join `RESULTS` and `CONSTRUCTORS`** on `"constructor_id"` to get constructor names.
- **Aggregate Functions** like `SUM("points")` to calculate total points.
- **Group By** `"year"`, `"driver_id"`, or `"constructor_id"` to summarize data per year.

### Sample SQL Queries to Understand the Data:

1. **List all years available in the `RACES` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM F1.F1."RACES"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Find all unique driver IDs in the `RESULTS` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id"
   FROM F1.F1."RESULTS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get the full names of drivers from the `DRIVERS` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "full_name"
   FROM F1.F1."DRIVERS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Retrieve constructor IDs and their names from `CONSTRUCTORS` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "name"
   FROM F1.F1."CONSTRUCTORS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Show race IDs along with their corresponding years and names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "year", "name"
   FROM F1.F1."RACES"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **View the points scored by drivers in each race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "driver_id", "points"
   FROM F1.F1."RESULTS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List all unique constructor IDs from the `RESULTS` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "constructor_id"
   FROM F1.F1."RESULTS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Get total points per driver across all races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1."RESULTS"
   GROUP BY "driver_id"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Get total points per constructor across all races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1."RESULTS"
   GROUP BY "constructor_id"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Find driver IDs and their associated constructors from `RESULTS`:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_id", "constructor_id"
    FROM F1.F1."RESULTS"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **List all races with their IDs and dates from `RACES`:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", "date"
    FROM F1.F1."RACES"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Retrieve the full names of drivers who participated in races:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT D."full_name"
    FROM F1.F1."RESULTS" R
    JOIN F1.F1."DRIVERS" D ON R."driver_id" = D."driver_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **List constructors involved in the races with their names:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT C."name"
    FROM F1.F1."RESULTS" R
    JOIN F1.F1."CONSTRUCTORS" C ON R."constructor_id" = C."constructor_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Show total points per driver per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT R."driver_id", RA."year", SUM(R."points") AS "total_points"
    FROM F1.F1."RESULTS" R
    JOIN F1.F1."RACES" RA ON R."race_id" = RA."race_id"
    GROUP BY R."driver_id", RA."year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Show total points per constructor per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT R."constructor_id", RA."year", SUM(R."points") AS "total_points"
    FROM F1.F1."RESULTS" R
    JOIN F1.F1."RACES" RA ON R."race_id" = RA."race_id"
    GROUP BY R."constructor_id", RA."year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help in exploring the data and understanding the relationships between drivers, constructors, races, and the points they scored. They also assist in identifying how to calculate total points per driver and constructor for each year, which is essential for addressing the original task.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM F1.F1."RACES"
   LIMIT 1000;

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To find the driver and constructor who scored the most points in each year, we need to:

1. **Calculate the total points** per driver and per constructor for each year from the `RESULTS` table.
2. **Join** the results with the `DRIVERS` table to get the full name of each driver.
3. **Join** the results with the `CONSTRUCTORS` table to get the name of each constructor.
4. **Select** the driver and constructor with the highest total points for each year.

Here is the requested information:

```csv
Year,DriverName,ConstructorName
year:int,full_name:str,name:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 16:22:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the driver and constructor who scored the most points in each year, we need to:

1. **Calculate the total points** per driver and per constructor for each year from the `RESULTS` table.
2. **Join** the results with the `DRIVERS` table to get the full name of each driver.
3. **Join** the results with the `CONSTRUCTORS` table to get the name of each constructor.
4. **Select** the driver and constructor with the highest total points for each year.

Here is the requested information:

```csv
Year,DriverName,ConstructorName
year:int,full_name:str,name:str
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
