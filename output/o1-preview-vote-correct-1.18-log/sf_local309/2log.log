   - `"driver_id"`: To join with DRIVER_STANDINGS.
   - `"full_name"`: To obtain the full name of the driver.
   - **Potential Usage:** Retrieve the full name of the top-scoring drivers.

4. **CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS**
   - `"race_id"`: To join with RACES to get the year.
   - `"constructor_id"`: To identify the constructor.
   - `"points"`: To sum up points per constructor per year.
   - **Potential Usage:** Calculate total points per constructor per year.

5. **CONSTRUCTORS**
   - `"constructor_id"`: To join with CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS.
   - `"name"`: To obtain the name of the constructor.
   - **Potential Usage:** Retrieve the name of the top-scoring constructors.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Joining `"race_id"` from DRIVER_STANDINGS and CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS with RACES to get the year.
- Grouping data by `"year"` and `"driver_id"` or `"constructor_id"` to sum points.
- Ordering results to identify the driver and constructor with the most points per year.

**Exploratory SQL Queries:**

1. **List all years available in the dataset:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
   ORDER BY "year" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve all unique drivers and their IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id", "full_name"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVERS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **View driver standings with points:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_standings_id", "race_id", "driver_id", "points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVER_STANDINGS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get races with corresponding years:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "year", "name"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Check how many points each driver scored in each race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "driver_id", "points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVER_STANDINGS"
   WHERE "points" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List all unique constructors and their IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "constructor_id", "name"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTORS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **View constructor standings with points:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_standings_id", "race_id", "constructor_id", "points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Check how many points each constructor scored in each race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "constructor_id", "points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS"
   WHERE "points" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Find the total number of races each year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "race_id") AS "total_races"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Retrieve driver standings for a specific year (e.g., 2020):**
    ```sql
    SELECT ds."driver_id", d."full_name", r."year", ds."points"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVER_STANDINGS" ds
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" r ON ds."race_id" = r."race_id"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."DRIVERS" d ON ds."driver_id" = d."driver_id"
    WHERE r."year" = 2020
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Retrieve constructor standings for a specific year (e.g., 2020):**
    ```sql
    SELECT cs."constructor_id", c."name", r."year", cs."points"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS" cs
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" r ON cs."race_id" = r."race_id"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTORS" c ON cs."constructor_id" = c."constructor_id"
    WHERE r."year" = 2020
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Check the total points per driver per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT r."year", ds."driver_id", SUM(ds."points") AS "total_points"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVER_STANDINGS" ds
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" r ON ds."race_id" = r."race_id"
    GROUP BY r."year", ds."driver_id"
    ORDER BY r."year", "total_points" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Check the total points per constructor per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT r."year", cs."constructor_id", SUM(cs."points") AS "total_points"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS" cs
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" r ON cs."race_id" = r."race_id"
    GROUP BY r."year", cs."constructor_id"
    ORDER BY r."year", "total_points" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Identify drivers with the most wins per year:**

    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Identify constructors with the most wins per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT r."year", cs."constructor_id", SUM(cs."wins") AS "total_wins"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS" cs
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" r ON cs."race_id" = r."race_id"
    GROUP BY r."year", cs."constructor_id"
    ORDER BY r."year", "total_wins" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Driver_Name,Constructor_Name
year:int,driver_full_name:str,constructor_name:str
...
```

**Explanation:** For each year, we have listed the driver and constructor who scored the most points. The `Driver_Name` column contains the full name of each top-scoring driver, and the `Constructor_Name` column contains the name of each top-scoring constructor. Since the exact data is not provided, the placeholders indicate the data types for each column..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 16:22:43 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Driver_Name,Constructor_Name
year:int,driver_full_name:str,constructor_name:str
...
```

**Explanation:** For each year, we have listed the driver and constructor who scored the most points. The `Driver_Name` column contains the full name of each top-scoring driver, and the `Constructor_Name` column contains the name of each top-scoring constructor. Since the exact data is not provided, the placeholders indicate the data types for each column. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
