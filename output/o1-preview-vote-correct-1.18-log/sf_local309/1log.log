**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **RACES Table**
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with RESULTS to get race details.
   - `"year"`: Identifies the year of each race.

2. **RESULTS Table**
   - `"race_id"`: To join with RACES.
   - `"driver_id"`: Identifies drivers in each race.
   - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies constructors in each race.
   - `"points"`: Points earned by drivers and constructors in each race.

3. **DRIVERS Table**
   - `"driver_id"`: To join with RESULTS.
   - `"full_name"`: Full name of each driver.

4. **CONSTRUCTORS Table**
   - `"constructor_id"`: To join with RESULTS.
   - `"name"`: Name of each constructor.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Joining `RESULTS` with `RACES` on `"race_id"` to get the year of each result.
- Grouping data by `"year"` and `"driver_id"` or `"constructor_id"` to calculate total points per year.
- Ordering results to find the driver and constructor with the highest points each year.
- Using `LIMIT` to restrict the number of rows returned in exploratory queries.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT r."year", res."driver_id", SUM(res."points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS res
   JOIN F1.F1.RACES r ON res."race_id" = r."race_id"

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine which driver and which constructor scored the most points for each year, we need to:

1. **Aggregate Driver Points**: Sum the points for each driver per year by joining the `RESULTS` table with the `RACES` table on `race_id`, grouping by `year` and `driver_id`.
2. **Aggregate Constructor Points**: Sum the points for each constructor per year similarly by joining the `RESULTS` table with the `RACES` table, grouping by `year` and `constructor_id`.
3. **Identify Top Scorers**: For each year, select the driver and constructor with the highest total points.
4. **Retrieve Full Names**: Join the results with the `DRIVERS` table to get the driver's full name and with the `CONSTRUCTORS` table to get the constructor's name.

The output format is:

```csv
Year,Driver_full_name,Constructor_name
year1:int,driver_full_name1:str,constructor_name1:str
year2:int,driver_full_name2:str,constructor_name2:str
...
```

This table lists, for each year, the driver (with full name) and the constructor who scored the most points..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 16:22:55 - root - INFO - To determine which driver and which constructor scored the most points for each year, we will perform the following steps:

1. **Aggregate Driver Points**: Sum the points for each driver per year by joining the `RESULTS` table with the `RACES` table on `race_id`, grouping by `year` and `driver_id`.
2. **Rank Drivers**: Use the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to rank drivers per year based on total points.
3. **Select Top Drivers**: Select the driver with the highest total points for each year.
4. **Aggregate Constructor Points**: Sum the points for each constructor per year similarly by joining the `RESULTS` table with the `RACES` table, grouping by `year` and `constructor_id`.
5. **Rank Constructors**: Use the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to rank constructors per year based on total points.
6. **Select Top Constructors**: Select the constructor with the highest total points for each year.
7. **Combine Results**: Join the top drivers and constructors per year.
8. **Retrieve Full Names**: Join with the `DRIVERS` table to get the driver's full name and with the `CONSTRUCTORS` table to get the constructor's name.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
WITH driver_points AS (
    SELECT
        r."year",
        res."driver_id",
        SUM(res."points") AS "total_points"

2025-01-19 16:22:57 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine which driver and which constructor scored the most points for each year, we need to:

1. **Aggregate Driver Points**: Sum the points for each driver per year by joining the `RESULTS` table with the `RACES` table on `race_id`, grouping by `year` and `driver_id`.
2. **Aggregate Constructor Points**: Sum the points for each constructor per year similarly by joining the `RESULTS` table with the `RACES` table, grouping by `year` and `constructor_id`.
3. **Identify Top Scorers**: For each year, select the driver and constructor with the highest total points.
4. **Retrieve Full Names**: Join the results with the `DRIVERS` table to get the driver's full name and with the `CONSTRUCTORS` table to get the constructor's name.

The output format is:

```csv
Year,Driver_full_name,Constructor_name
year1:int,driver_full_name1:str,constructor_name1:str
year2:int,driver_full_name2:str,constructor_name2:str
...
```

This table lists, for each year, the driver (with full name) and the constructor who scored the most points. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
