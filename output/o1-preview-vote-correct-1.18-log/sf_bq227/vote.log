After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Identification of Top 5 Minor Crime Categories:**
   - It correctly identifies the top 5 minor crime categories based on the 2008 data:
     - **Other Theft**
     - **Theft From Motor Vehicle**
     - **Possession Of Drugs**
     - **Burglary in a Dwelling**
     - **Assault with Injury**

2. **Percentage Calculations:**
   - It calculates the annual percentage shares of these top 5 categories in London's total crimes for each year, starting from 2008.
   - The percentages are calculated accurately by dividing the total crimes of each minor category by the total crimes of the year and multiplying by 100.

3. **Rounding to Two Decimal Places:**
   - The percentages are correctly rounded to **two decimal places**, as specified in the task.
   - This is achieved using the `ROUND()` function with a precision of 2.

4. **Meaningful Column Names:**
   - The output columns are labeled with the actual names of the minor crime categories, providing clarity and making the data easy to interpret.
   - This adheres to the requirement of not using generic labels like 'Minor_Category_1'.

5. **Each Year Displayed in One Row:**
   - The results display each year on a single row, with corresponding percentages for the top 5 categories, fulfilling the task's formatting requirement.

6. **Compliance with Task Instructions:**
   - The SQL script aligns perfectly with the task's specifications, ensuring that all conditions are met without unnecessary complexity.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**

```plain
2result.sql
```
