Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA`

    - **Columns and Potential Usage:**
        - `"minor_category"`: Identify minor crime categories to determine the top 5 categories from 2008.
        - `"value"`: Used to sum the number of crimes per category and per year.
        - `"year"`: Filter data for the year 2008 and subsequent years; used to aggregate data annually.
        - `"major_category"`: Could be used for broader crime category analysis if needed.
        - `"borough"`: May be useful for geographical analysis.
        - `"month"`: Could be used for monthly trends, but not essential for annual data.
        - `"lsoa_code"`: Lower Layer Super Output Area code; might be less relevant for this task.

- **Conditions that May Be Used:**
    - `"year" = 2008`: To focus on data from the year 2008.
    - `"year" >= 2008`: To include data from 2008 onward.
    - `"minor_category" ILIKE '%<search_term>%'`: For fuzzy matching of minor categories.
    - `"value" IS NOT NULL`: Ensure that the crime counts are available.

*Note:* These queries are designed to help understand the structure and contents of the `CRIME_BY_LSOA` table within the `LONDON_CRIME` schema. They explore different columns and conditions to gain insights into the data, which is essential before performing more complex analyses.

Each query:

- Uses double quotations around column names as required.
- Is limited to simple `SELECT` statements without nested queries or CTEs.
- Includes `LIMIT 1000` to restrict the number of returned rows.
- Avoids directly answering the original task.

By running these queries, one can familiarize themselves with the dataset, which will be helpful for any further analysis or tasks.Query:

Task: Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, we need to analyze the data from the `CRIME_BY_LSOA` table in the `LONDON_CRIME` schema.

**Expected CSV Format:**

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1,Minor_Category_2,Minor_Category_3,Minor_Category_4,Minor_Category_5
2008,percentage1,percentage2,percentage3,percentage4,percentage5
2009,percentage1,percentage2,percentage3,percentage4,percentage5
2010,percentage1,percentage2,percentage3,percentage4,percentage5
...
```

*Note:* Replace `Minor_Category_1` to `Minor_Category_5` with the actual names of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008. Replace `percentage1` to `percentage5` with the calculated percentage shares for each year, rounded to two decimal places.

**Brief Explanation:**

1. **Identify Top 5 Minor Crime Categories from 2008:**
   - Sum the `value` column (which represents the number of crimes) for each `minor_category` where `year` is 2008.
   - Sort the results in descending order based on the summed values.
   - Select the top 5 `minor_category` names with the highest total crimes.

2. **Calculate Annual Total Crimes:**
   - For each year, sum the `value` column to get the total number of crimes in London for that year.

3. **Calculate Crimes for Each Top Minor Category per Year:**
   - For each of the top 5 minor categories, sum the `value` column for each year to get the total crimes in that category per year.

4. **Compute Percentage Shares:**
   - Calculate the percentage share for each top minor category per year using the formula:
     - **Percentage Share** = (Crimes in Minor Category ÷ Total Crimes in Year) × 100
     - Round the result to two decimal places.

5. **Compile the Results:**
   - Organize the calculated percentages into the CSV format as shown above, with each year as a row.

**Example Row (with hypothetical data):**

```csv
Year,Theft from Person,Other Theft,Burglary in a Dwelling,Common Assault,Criminal Damage to Vehicle
2008,12.35,10.24,8.15,7.05,6.22
```

*Please note that the category names and percentages above are for illustration purposes only.*

Since the actual data is not provided, I cannot compute the specific percentages. By following the steps outlined, you can retrieve the necessary data from your database and calculate the percentages accordingly..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
