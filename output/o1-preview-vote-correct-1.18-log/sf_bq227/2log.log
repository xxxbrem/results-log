Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, the relevant table and columns are:

- **Table**: `LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA`

- **Columns and Potential Usage**:
  - `"minor_category"`: Used to identify and group crimes by minor crime categories.
  - `"value"`: Represents the number of crime occurrences; used to sum the total number of crimes.
  - `"year"`: Used to filter data for specific years (e.g., starting from 2008) and display annual data.
  - `"month"`: May be used for monthly analysis if needed.
  - `"major_category"`: Provides broader categories of crimes; useful for additional context.
  - `"borough"`: Could be used for geographical analysis if required.

- **Conditions that May Be Used**:
  - `"year" = 2008`: To filter records specifically for the year 2008.
  - `"year" >= 2008`: To include records from 2008 onwards.
  - Filtering by `"minor_category"` to focus on specific crime types.

Here are 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

```sql
-- 1. List all distinct years in the dataset
SELECT DISTINCT "year"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. List all distinct minor crime categories
SELECT DISTINCT "minor_category"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
LIMIT 1000;

-- 3. List all distinct major crime categories
SELECT DISTINCT "major_category"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
LIMIT 1000;

-- 4. Retrieve total number of crimes per year
SELECT "year", SUM("value") AS total_crimes
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year" ASC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. Retrieve total number of crimes per minor category in 2008
SELECT "minor_category", SUM("value") AS total_crimes
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "year" = 2008
GROUP BY "minor_category"
ORDER BY total_crimes DESC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 6. List all distinct boroughs in the dataset
SELECT DISTINCT "borough"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
LIMIT 1000;

-- 7. Retrieve total number of crimes per month in 2008
SELECT "month", SUM("value") AS total_crimes
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "year" = 2008
GROUP BY "month"
ORDER BY "month" ASC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 8. Retrieve total number of crimes per major category in 2008
SELECT "major_category", SUM("value") AS total_crimes
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "year" = 2008
GROUP BY "major_category"
ORDER BY total_crimes DESC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 9. List total crimes per minor category across all years
SELECT "minor_category", SUM("value") AS total_crimes
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
GROUP BY "minor_category"
ORDER BY total_crimes DESC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 10. Retrieve total number of crimes per year starting from 2008
SELECT "year", SUM("value") AS total_crimes
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "year" >= 2008
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year" ASC
LIMIT 1000;
```

Task: Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row, the data can be structured as follows:

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1,Minor_Category_2,Minor_Category_3,Minor_Category_4,Minor_Category_5
year1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100,percentage2:0<=float<=100,percentage3:0<=float<=100,percentage4:0<=float<=100,percentage5:0<=float<=100
year2:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100,percentage2:0<=float<=100,percentage3:0<=float<=100,percentage4:0<=float<=100,percentage5:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The specific year (e.g., 2008, 2009, etc.).
- **Minor_Category_1 to Minor_Category_5**: The top 5 minor crime categories identified from 2008 data.
- **percentage1 to percentage5**: The percentage share of each minor crime category in the total number of crimes for that year, rounded to two decimal places and without the '%' symbol.

Each row represents a year, and the columns provide the percentage shares of each of the top 5 minor crime categories in that year's total crimes across London..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 03:55:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row, the data can be structured as follows:

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1,Minor_Category_2,Minor_Category_3,Minor_Category_4,Minor_Category_5
year1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100,percentage2:0<=float<=100,percentage3:0<=float<=100,percentage4:0<=float<=100,percentage5:0<=float<=100
year2:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100,percentage2:0<=float<=100,percentage3:0<=float<=100,percentage4:0<=float<=100,percentage5:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The specific year (e.g., 2008, 2009, etc.).
- **Minor_Category_1 to Minor_Category_5**: The top 5 minor crime categories identified from 2008 data.
- **percentage1 to percentage5**: The percentage share of each minor crime category in the total number of crimes for that year, rounded to two decimal places and without the '%' symbol.

Each row represents a year, and the columns provide the percentage shares of each of the top 5 minor crime categories in that year's total crimes across London. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
