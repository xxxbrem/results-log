After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **0result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Use of Indicator Code:** The query in **0result.sql** filters data using the indicator code `'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN'`, which uniquely identifies the "Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people)" indicator. Using the indicator code ensures precise selection of the intended indicator without ambiguity.

- **Avoiding Ambiguity with Indicator Names:** The query in **2result.sql** relies on the indicator name. While indicator names are descriptive, they may have slight variations, typos, or could change over time. Relying on the indicator code is more reliable because codes are standardized and less likely to introduce errors.

- **Data Integrity:** Using the indicator code ensures consistency across the dataset and reduces the risk of accidentally including or excluding data due to discrepancies in indicator naming.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
