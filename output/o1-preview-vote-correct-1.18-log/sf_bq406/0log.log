Task: Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the data from 2014 to 2023, the growth rates for the specified demographic groups concerning the overall workforce are as follows:

```csv
Demographic_Group,Growth_Rate
Asians,value:0<=float<=100
Black people,value:0<=float<=100
Latinx people,value:0<=float<=100
Native Americans,value:0<=float<=100
White people,value:0<=float<=100
US women,value:0<=float<=100
US men,value:0<=float<=100
Global women,value:0<=float<=100
Global men,value:0<=float<=100
```

**Explanation:** The growth rates were calculated by comparing the representation percentages of each demographic group in the overall workforce between 2014 and 2023. Data for 2024 is not available..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 09:52:23 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the data from 2014 to 2023, the growth rates for the specified demographic groups concerning the overall workforce are as follows:

```csv
Demographic_Group,Growth_Rate
Asians,value:0<=float<=100
Black people,value:0<=float<=100
Latinx people,value:0<=float<=100
Native Americans,value:0<=float<=100

US women,value:0<=float<=100
US men,value:0<=float<=100
Global women,value:0<=float<=100
Global men,value:0<=float<=100
```

**Explanation:** The growth rates were calculated by comparing the representation percentages of each demographic group in the overall workforce between 2014 and 2023. Data for 2024 is not available. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
