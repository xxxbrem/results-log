2025-01-19 09:53:30 - root - INFO - Based on the data provided, here is the calculated growth rate for Asians in the overall workforce from 2014 to 2024:

```csv
Demographic,Growth_Rate
Asian,45.08
```

**Explanation:**

The growth rate for Asians in the overall workforce from 2014 to 2024 is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2024} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Plugging in the values:

- **Value in 2014**: 31.5% (0.315)
- **Value in 2024**: 45.7% (0.457)

Calculation:

\[ \text{Growth Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{0.457 - 0.315}{0.315} \right) \times 100\% \approx 45.08\% \]

This means that the representation of Asians in the overall workforce increased by approximately **45.08%** from 2014 to 2024.

*Note: Data for other demographic groups is required to calculate their respective growth rates.*

Task: Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Data for the year 2024 is not yet available. However, the growth rates for the specified demographic groups from 2014 to the latest available year can be represented as follows:

```csv
Asian,Black,Latinx,Native_American,White,US_women,US_men,Global_women,Global_men
growth_rate_asian:float,growth_rate_black:float,growth_rate_latinx:float,growth_rate_native_american:float,growth_rate_white:float,growth_rate_us_women:float,growth_rate_us_men:float,growth_rate_global_women:float,growth_rate_global_men:float
(Attention: Answer in one row)
```

This table shows the growth rates (as percentages) for each demographic group concerning the overall workforce from 2014 to the latest available year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 10:02:25 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Data for the year 2024 is not yet available. However, the growth rates for the specified demographic groups from 2014 to the latest available year can be represented as follows:

```csv
Asian,Black,Latinx,Native_American,White,US_women,US_men,Global_women,Global_men
growth_rate_asian:float,growth_rate_black:float,growth_rate_latinx:float,growth_rate_native_american:float,growth_rate_white:float,growth_rate_us_women:float,growth_rate_us_men:float,growth_rate_global_women:float,growth_rate_global_men:float
(Attention: Answer in one row)
```

This table shows the growth rates (as percentages) for each demographic group concerning the overall workforce from 2014 to the latest available year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
