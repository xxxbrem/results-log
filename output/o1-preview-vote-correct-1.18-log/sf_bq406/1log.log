Begin Exploring Related Columns
To calculate the growth rates for various demographics from 2014 to the latest available year concerning the overall workforce, we first need to identify the relevant tables and columns.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION` (in `GOOGLE_DEI.GOOGLE_DEI`)
  - **"workforce"**: Potential usage - Filter data for the overall workforce or specific workforce categories.
  - **"report_year"**: Potential usage - Select data between 2014 and the latest available year.
  - **"race_asian"**: Potential usage - Percentage representation of Asians in the workforce.
  - **"race_black"**: Potential usage - Percentage representation of Black people in the workforce.
  - **"race_hispanic_latinx"**: Potential usage - Percentage representation of Latinx people in the workforce.
  - **"race_native_american"**: Potential usage - Percentage representation of Native Americans in the workforce.
  - **"race_white"**: Potential usage - Percentage representation of White people in the workforce.
  - **"gender_us_women"**: Potential usage - Percentage representation of US women in the workforce.
  - **"gender_us_men"**: Potential usage - Percentage representation of US men in the workforce.
  - **"gender_global_women"**: Potential usage - Percentage representation of global women in the workforce.
  - **"gender_global_men"**: Potential usage - Percentage representation of global men in the workforce.

- **Table:** `DAR_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION` (in `GOOGLE_DEI.GOOGLE_DEI`)
  - **"gender_us"**: Potential usage - Filter data by gender within the US.
  - **"race_asian"**, **"race_black"**, **"race_hispanic_latinx"**, **"race_native_american"**, **"race_white"**: Same as above, for intersectional analysis.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filter by "workforce":** Use `"workforce" = 'Overall'` to focus on the overall workforce data.
- **Filter by "report_year":** Use `"report_year" BETWEEN 2014 AND [latest_year]` to select data from 2014 to the latest available year.
- **Order by "report_year":** Use `ORDER BY "report_year"` to analyze trends over time.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Get distinct workforce categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "workforce"
   FROM GOOGLE_DEI.GOOGLE_DEI.DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION;
   ```

2. **Find the range of report years:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("report_year") AS "min_year", MAX("report_year") AS "max_year"
   FROM GOOGLE_DEI.GOOGLE_DEI.DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION;
   ```

3. **Retrieve Asian representation percentages by year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "report_year", "race_asian"
   FROM GOOGLE_DEI.GOOGLE_DEI.DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION
   WHERE "workforce" = 'Overall'
   ORDER BY "report_year";
   ```

4. **Retrieve Black representation percentages by year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "report_year", "race_black"
   FROM GOOGLE_DEI.GOOGLE_DEI.DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION
   WHERE "workforce" = 'Overall'
   ORDER BY "report_year";
   ```

5. **Retrieve Latinx representation percentages by year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "report_year", "race_hispanic_latinx"
   FROM GOOGLE_DEI.GOOGLE_DEI.DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION
   WHERE "workforce" = 'Overall'
   ORDER BY "report_year";
   ```

6. **Retrieve Native American representation percentages by year:**

Task: Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The growth rates for various demographics from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce are as follows:

```csv
Demographic: str,Growth_rate: float
Asians,rate:float
Black_people,rate:float
Latinx_people,rate:float
Native_Americans,rate:float
White_people,rate:float
US_women,rate:float
US_men,rate:float
global_women,rate:float
global_men,rate:float
```

*Note: The growth rates are calculated based on data from 2014 to the latest available year, as data for 2024 is not yet available.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 10:00:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The growth rates for various demographics from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce are as follows:

```csv
Demographic: str,Growth_rate: float
Asians,rate:float
Black_people,rate:float
Latinx_people,rate:float

global_women,rate:float
global_men,rate:float
```

*Note: The growth rates are calculated based on data from 2014 to the latest available year, as data for 2024 is not yet available.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-19 10:01:48 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The growth rates for various demographics from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce are as follows:

```csv
Demographic: str,Growth_rate: float
Asians,rate:float
Black_people,rate:float
Latinx_people,rate:float
Native_Americans,rate:float
White_people,rate:float
US_women,rate:float
US_men,rate:float
global_women,rate:float
global_men,rate:float
```

*Note: The growth rates are calculated based on data from 2014 to the latest available year, as data for 2024 is not yet available.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
