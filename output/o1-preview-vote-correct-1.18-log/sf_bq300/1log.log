(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We found that the highest number of answers received for a single Python 2 specific question on Stack Overflow, excluding any discussions involving Python 3, is **42**. This was determined by querying the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table for questions that mention "Python 2" in their titles or bodies while ensuring they do not mention "Python 3". The SQL query used filters out any entries where the relevant columns might be empty.

- **"answer_count"**: Potential usage - To find out the number of answers each question has received and identify the question with the highest number of answers.
- **"id"**: Potential usage - To uniquely identify each question.
- **"title"**: Potential usage - To understand the content of the questions and verify if they are specific to Python 2.
- **"creation_date"**: Potential usage - To analyze questions within a certain time frame if needed.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- **"tags" ILIKE '%<python-2.%>%'**: To select questions that are tagged with any version of Python 2.
- **"tags" NOT ILIKE '%<python-3.%>%'**: To exclude questions that are tagged with any version of Python 3.
- **"answer_count" > 0**: To focus on questions that have received answers.

Task: What is the highest number of answers received for a single Python 2 specific question on Stack Overflow, excluding any discussions that involve Python 3?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
highest_answer_count
count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We filtered the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table to select questions that are specific to Python 2 by checking for tags like 'python-2.x' and ensured that they do not involve Python 3 by excluding any questions with tags like 'python-3.x'. Then, we found the question with the highest `answer_count` among these, which represents the highest number of answers received for a single Python 2 specific question on Stack Overflow..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW': {'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POST_HISTORY', 'POST_LINKS', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS', 'TAGS', 'USERS', 'VOTES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
