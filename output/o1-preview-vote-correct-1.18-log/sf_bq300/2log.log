<p>I added the following couple of lines to one of my tests: </p>

<p>The funny thing: this code seems to run fine when I'm just running it from a plain python console, but it results in the above ImportError under Django or under the django manage.py shell. </p>

<p>Any idea what might be wrong? </p>

<p>( some additional details about the location of the six module: </p>

27634895,"<p>I have a rhel machine with python2.6 installed on it. I've been trying to have an alternate install of python2.7 and set up a virtualenv for using 2.7. I installed python2.7 by building from source as follows:</p>

<pre><code>./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-unicode=ucs4 --enable-shared LDFLAGS=""-Wl,-rpath /usr/local/lib"" 
make &amp;&amp; make altinstall
</code></pre>

<p>I already had virtualenv installed on the system so I used it to create a venv for 2.7 as follows:</p>

<pre><code>virtualenv -p python2.7 --no-setuptools py27
. py27/bin/activate

<p>Now when I try to install pip inside the venv, it fails like so:</p>

- **Table:** `POSTS_QUESTIONS` (in `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW`)

  - **"tags"**: Potential usage - To identify questions specifically about Python 2 by looking for tags like `<python-2.x>`, `<python-2.7>`, etc., and to exclude questions involving Python 3 by ensuring tags like `<python-3.x>`, `<python-3.6>`, etc., are not present.

  - **"title"**: Potential usage - To check for mentions of "Python 2" in the question title and exclude any mentions of "Python 3".

  - **"body"**: Potential usage - To search for mentions of "Python 2" in the question body, excluding any mentions of "Python 3".

  - **"answer_count"**: Potential usage - To determine the number of answers received for each question.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Use `LIKE` or `ILIKE` operators to search within the "tags", "title", and "body" columns.
- Use patterns like `'%<python-2%>%'` to find tags related to Python 2.
- Exclude patterns like `'%<python-3%>%'` to avoid questions related to Python 3.
- Ensure that the "tags" column is not `NULL` when performing searches.

**SQL Queries to explore the data:**

```sql
-- Query 1: View distinct tags to understand the format of the "tags" column
SELECT DISTINCT "tags"

  AND "body" NOT ILIKE '%python 3%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 8: Find the maximum number of answers received by any question
SELECT MAX("answer_count")
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS";

-- Query 9: Find the maximum number of answers for Python 2 questions excluding Python 3 discussions
SELECT MAX("answer_count")
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
WHERE "tags" LIKE '%<python-2%>%'
  AND "tags" NOT LIKE '%<python-3%>%';

-- Query 10: List Python 2 questions (excluding Python 3) ordered by highest answer count
SELECT "id", "title", "answer_count"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
WHERE "tags" LIKE '%<python-2%>%'
  AND "tags" NOT LIKE '%<python-3%>%'
ORDER BY "answer_count" DESC

-- Query 11: Count the number of Python 2 questions excluding Python 3
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
WHERE "tags" LIKE '%<python-2%>%'
  AND "tags" NOT LIKE '%<python-3%>%';

-- Query 12: Get distinct Python 2 related tags used in the data
SELECT DISTINCT "tags"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
WHERE "tags" LIKE '%<python-2%>%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 13: Find the average number of answers for Python 2 questions excluding Python 3 discussions
SELECT AVG("answer_count")
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
WHERE "tags" LIKE '%<python-2%>%'
  AND "tags" NOT LIKE '%<python-3%>%';

-- Query 14: Identify questions tagged with both Python 2 and Python 3 (if any)
SELECT "id", "tags", "title"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
WHERE "tags" LIKE '%<python-2%>%'
  AND "tags" LIKE '%<python-3%>%'
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 15: Find questions tagged with 'python' in general, ordered by answer count
SELECT "id", "tags", "title", "answer_count"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
WHERE "tags" LIKE '%<python>%'
ORDER BY "answer_count" DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

These queries will help you explore the structure of the data, understand how Python-related tags are stored, and identify questions relevant to Python 2 while excluding those involving Python 3. They also help in analyzing the answer counts associated with these questions.Query:

Task: What is the highest number of answers received for a single Python 2 specific question on Stack Overflow, excluding any discussions that involve Python 3?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Highest_number_of_answers
42
```

Therefore, the highest number of answers received for a single Python 2 specific question on Stack Overflow, excluding any discussions that involve Python 3, is **42**..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW': {'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POST_HISTORY', 'POST_LINKS', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS', 'TAGS', 'USERS', 'VOTES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
