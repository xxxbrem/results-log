The correct SQL query is:

```plain
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

We are asked to find the highest number of answers received for a single Python 2 specific question on Stack Overflow, excluding any discussions that involve Python 3.

Among the two candidate SQL queries:

1. **0result.sql**

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX("answer_count") AS "Highest_number_of_answers"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS
   WHERE "tags" LIKE '%python-2%' AND "tags" NOT LIKE '%python-3%';
   ```

   - **Approach:** This query selects questions where the `"tags"` field includes `python-2` and excludes any questions where `"tags"` includes `python-3`.
   - **Result:** Returns the maximum `"answer_count"` for these questions, which is **43**.

2. **1result.sql**

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX("answer_count") AS "highest_answer_count"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE ("title" ILIKE '%python 2%' OR "body" ILIKE '%python 2%')
     AND ("title" NOT ILIKE '%python 3%' AND "body" NOT ILIKE '%python 3%');
   ```

   - **Approach:** This query selects questions where the `"title"` or `"body"` contains `python 2`, and excludes any questions where `"title"` or `"body"` contains `python 3`.
   - **Result:** Returns the maximum `"answer_count"` for these questions, which is **42**.

**Why `0result.sql` is the correct choice:**

- **Use of Tags:** The first query uses the `"tags"` field to identify Python 2 specific questions and exclude Python 3 discussions. Tags are a reliable and structured way to categorize questions on Stack Overflow.

- **Specificity:** By filtering on `"tags" LIKE '%python-2%'`, the query targets questions explicitly tagged with Python 2, ensuring relevance to the version-specific inquiry.

- **Exclusion of Python 3 Discussions:** The condition `"tags" NOT LIKE '%python-3%'` ensures that any question involving Python 3 discussions is excluded.

- **Higher Answer Count:** The result from `0result.sql` shows the highest number of answers is **43**, which is higher than the **42** returned by `1result.sql`. This suggests that using tags may have captured a question with more answers relevant to Python 2.

- **Structured Data over Free Text:** Relying on the `"tags"` field is preferable over searching free-text fields like `"title"` and `"body"` because tags are assigned deliberately to classify questions, reducing the chance of missing relevant questions or including irrelevant ones.

Therefore, `0result.sql` provides a more accurate and reliable answer to the question posed.
