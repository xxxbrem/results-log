2025-01-19 05:01:32 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering an error when running the following query:

```sql
SELECT "trip_id", "bike_type"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE "bike_type" = 'Electric'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
001065 (22023): SQL compilation error:
Function TRY_CAST cannot be used with arguments of types NUMBER(38,6) and TIMESTAMP_LTZ(6)
```

This error suggests that there's an implicit or automatic type conversion happening, possibly due to a computed column, a view, or a policy that attempts to cast a `NUMBER(38,6)` to a `TIMESTAMP_LTZ(6)`, which is not allowed.

Here's how we can address this issue:

### **1. Check the Data Types of the Columns**

First, verify the data types of the columns in your table to ensure they are as expected.

```sql
DESC TABLE AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS;
```

Ensure that:

- `"bike_type"` is of type `VARCHAR`.
- `"start_time"` is of type `NUMBER`.

### **2. Use Correct Case Sensitivity or Case-Insensitive Matching**

In SQL, string comparisons are case-sensitive by default. From your earlier query results, the distinct values in the `"bike_type"` column are:

- `classic`
- `electric`

Note that both are in lowercase. Therefore, when filtering on `"bike_type"`, you should use the correct casing or perform a case-insensitive comparison.

**Option 1: Use Lowercase String**

```sql
SELECT "trip_id", "bike_type"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE "bike_type" = 'electric'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Option 2: Use `ILIKE` for Case-Insensitive Comparison**

```sql
SELECT "trip_id", "bike_type"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE "bike_type" ILIKE 'electric'
LIMIT 1000;
```

### **3. Check for Null or Unexpected Values**

If there are null or unexpected values in the `"bike_type"` column, they might cause issues.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "bike_type"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS;
```

Review the distinct values and ensure they are all valid string representations.

### **4. Simplify the Query**

If the error persists, try simplifying the query to isolate the issue.

**a. Select Without Filtering**

```sql
SELECT "trip_id", "bike_type"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
LIMIT 10;
```

If this query runs without errors, the issue is likely with the WHERE clause.

**b. Remove the `"bike_type"` Column**

```sql
SELECT "trip_id"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE "bike_type" = 'electric'
LIMIT 10;
```

If the error still occurs, the problem might be related to implicit casting or data type issues elsewhere in the table.

### **5. Examine the `"start_time"` Column**

Given that previous errors mentioned issues with timestamp conversion, the `"start_time"` column might be causing problems.

**a. Review Sample Values**

```sql
SELECT "start_time"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
LIMIT 10;
```

**b. Check Conversion to Timestamp**

Attempt to convert `"start_time"` to a timestamp, adjusting for the correct time unit (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds).

```sql
SELECT 
  "start_time",
  TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time") AS start_time_ts
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
LIMIT 10;
```

If this results in an error, try dividing `"start_time"` by 1,000 or 1,000,000:

```sql
SELECT 
  "start_time",
  TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000) AS start_time_ts_millis,
  TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000000) AS start_time_ts_micros
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
LIMIT 10;
```

**Note:** Use `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` if you expect some values might not convert properly.

### **6. Handling the Error**

Based on the error message, the issue might stem from an automatic conversion attempt on a numeric field. To prevent this:

- Ensure that no implicit conversions are happening in your query.
- Use explicit casting if necessary.
- Validate data types and values in the columns involved.

### **Revised Query to Address the Issue**

Assuming the issue is with case sensitivity and potential data type mismatches, here's a revised query:

```sql
SELECT "trip_id", "bike_type"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE "bike_type" ILIKE 'electric'
LIMIT 1000;
```

If you need to filter further based on `"start_time"`, ensure that you handle the data types correctly:

```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time")) AS ride_date, 
  COUNT(*) AS number_of_rides
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE
  "subscriber_type" = 'Student Membership' AND 
  "bike_type" ILIKE 'electric' AND
  "duration_minutes" > 10 AND
  "start_station_name" NOT ILIKE '%Mobile Station%' AND
  "start_station_name" NOT ILIKE '%Repair Shop%' AND
  "end_station_name" NOT ILIKE '%Mobile Station%' AND
  "end_station_name" NOT ILIKE '%Repair Shop%'
GROUP BY DATE(TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time"))
ORDER BY number_of_rides DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Note:** Adjust the conversion of `"start_time"` based on the correct time unit.

### **Summary**

- Use case-insensitive comparison with `ILIKE` for string matching.
- Verify data types and handle any implicit conversions explicitly.
- Adjust time conversions based on the actual units used in the `"start_time"` column.
- Simplify the query to isolate and identify the source of the error.

Let me know if you need further assistance or if the issue persists after these adjustments.

Task: What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Max_Rides
number_of_rides:int > 0 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The value represents the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides that started or ended at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATIONS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive and negative signs.

2025-01-19 05:04:05 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Max_Rides
number_of_rides:int > 0 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The value represents the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides that started or ended at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
