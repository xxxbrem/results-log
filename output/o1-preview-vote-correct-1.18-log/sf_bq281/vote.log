After comparing the two SQL queries and their corresponding results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Filtering Criteria:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses:
     ```sql
     "start_station_name" NOT IN ('Mobile Station', 'Repair Shop')
     AND "end_station_name" NOT IN ('Mobile Station', 'Repair Shop')
     ```
     This filters out trips where the station names are exactly 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'.

   - **`1result.sql`** uses:
     ```sql
     "start_station_name" NOT ILIKE '%Mobile Station%'
     AND "start_station_name" NOT ILIKE '%Repair Shop%'
     AND "end_station_name" NOT ILIKE '%Mobile Station%'
     AND "end_station_name" NOT ILIKE '%Repair Shop%'
     ```
     This filters out trips where the station names contain 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop' anywhere in the name.

2. **Comprehensive Exclusion:**
   - The use of `NOT ILIKE '%Mobile Station%'` and `NOT ILIKE '%Repair Shop%'` in **`1result.sql`** ensures that any station names containing those phrases are excluded, covering variations like 'Mobile Station @ Unplugged', 'Mobile Station @ Boardwalk Opening Ceremony', etc.
   - **`0result.sql`** may miss trips starting or ending at stations with names that include 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop' but are not exactly those names.

3. **Consistent with Data Observations:**
   - Based on the data exploration queries provided earlier, station names containing 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop' may have additional descriptors.
   - Using `ILIKE` with wildcards (`%`) in **`1result.sql`** aligns with those observations, ensuring all relevant trips are excluded.

4. **Result Integrity:**
   - Both queries yield the same maximum daily count of **201**, but **`1result.sql`** provides a more accurate and comprehensive filtering, increasing confidence in the result.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
1result.sql
```
