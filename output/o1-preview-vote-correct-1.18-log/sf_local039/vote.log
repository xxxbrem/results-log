After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have chosen the second SQL query (`2result.sql`) as the correct answer. The reason is as follows:

- **Correct Timestamp Parsing**: The second query uses `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP` with the format `'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3'`, which accurately matches the timestamp format in the `rental_date` and `return_date` columns. This ensures that the rental durations are calculated correctly.
  
- **Accurate Rental Duration Calculation**: By computing the difference in seconds between the rental and return timestamps and then converting it to hours (`/ 3600.0`), the query accurately calculates the total rental hours.
  
- **Proper City Filtering**: The query correctly filters the cities using `CITY."city" ILIKE 'A%' OR CITY."city" LIKE '%-%'`, which includes cities starting with "A" (case-insensitive) or containing a hyphen.
  
- **Excludes Null Return Dates**: It ensures that only rentals with a non-null `return_date` are considered by including `RENTAL."return_date" IS NOT NULL` in the `WHERE` clause.

Therefore, the second SQL query aligns well with the requirements and provides the correct result.

The correct SQL is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
