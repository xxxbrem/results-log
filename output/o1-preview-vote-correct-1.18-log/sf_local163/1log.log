Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, I will first identify the relevant tables and columns, then provide simple SQL queries to understand the data.

**Relevant Table:**

- `EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"FacFirstName"`: Faculty member's first name.
- `"FacLastName"`: Faculty member's last name.
- `"FacRank"`: Faculty member's rank.
- `"FacSalary"`: Faculty member's salary.
- `"FacDept"`: Faculty member's department (could be useful for additional insights).
- `"FacHireDate"`: Faculty member's hire date (if needed for tenure analysis).

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Calculating the average salary per rank.
- Finding faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their rank.
- Ensuring salaries are valid (non-null and positive values).

**Sample SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **List all distinct faculty ranks:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "FacRank"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Calculate the average salary per rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all faculty members with their ranks and salaries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Find the minimum and maximum salary for each rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", MIN("FacSalary") AS "MinSalary", MAX("FacSalary") AS "MaxSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **List faculty members ordered by salary ascending:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   WHERE "FacSalary" IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY "FacSalary" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List faculty members ordered by salary descending:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   WHERE "FacSalary" IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY "FacSalary" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Count the number of faculty members per rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", COUNT(*) AS "FacultyCount"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **List the departments and the average salary in each:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacDept", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacDept"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Find faculty members hired before a certain date (e.g., '2010-01-01'):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacHireDate"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   WHERE TRY_TO_DATE("FacHireDate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') < '2010-01-01'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Calculate the standard deviation of salaries per rank:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacRank", STDDEV("FacSalary") AS "SalaryStdDev"
    FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
    GROUP BY "FacRank"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the structure and values of the relevant columns in the `UNIVERSITY_FACULTY` table. They provide insights into the distribution of ranks, salaries, and other attributes, which is essential for solving the task.Query:

Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks are:

```csv
Rank,FirstName,LastName,Salary
rank1:str,FirstName1:str,LastName1:str,Salary1:int
rank2:str,FirstName2:str,LastName2:str,Salary2:int
...
```

**Explanation:** For each faculty rank, we calculated the average salary and identified the faculty member whose salary is closest to that average. The table lists the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries of these faculty members..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': {'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': ['HARDWARE_DIM_CUSTOMER', 'HARDWARE_DIM_PRODUCT', 'HARDWARE_FACT_GROSS_PRICE', 'HARDWARE_FACT_MANUFACTURING_COST', 'HARDWARE_FACT_PRE_INVOICE_DEDUCTIONS', 'HARDWARE_FACT_SALES_MONTHLY', 'SALARYDATASET', 'STAFFHOURS', 'UNIVERSITY_COURSE', 'UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT', 'UNIVERSITY_FACULTY', 'UNIVERSITY_OFFERING', 'UNIVERSITY_STUDENT', 'WEB_ACCOUNTS', 'WEB_EVENTS', 'WEB_ORDERS', 'WEB_REGION', 'WEB_SALES_REPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
