After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that both queries accomplish the task correctly by finding the faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks. However, **`1result.sql`** is more straightforward and uses clearer aliases, making it easier to read and understand.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
