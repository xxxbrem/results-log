Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Rank,FirstName,LastName,Salary
rank1:str,firstname1:str,lastname1:str,salary1:int
rank2:str,firstname2:str,lastname2:str,salary2:int
...
```

For each faculty rank, we identified the faculty member whose salary is closest to the average salary of their respective rank and provided their rank, first name, last name, and salary..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': {'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': ['HARDWARE_DIM_CUSTOMER', 'HARDWARE_DIM_PRODUCT', 'HARDWARE_FACT_GROSS_PRICE', 'HARDWARE_FACT_MANUFACTURING_COST', 'HARDWARE_FACT_PRE_INVOICE_DEDUCTIONS', 'HARDWARE_FACT_SALES_MONTHLY', 'SALARYDATASET', 'STAFFHOURS', 'UNIVERSITY_COURSE', 'UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT', 'UNIVERSITY_FACULTY', 'UNIVERSITY_OFFERING', 'UNIVERSITY_STUDENT', 'WEB_ACCOUNTS', 'WEB_EVENTS', 'WEB_ORDERS', 'WEB_REGION', 'WEB_SALES_REPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 15:00:42 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Rank,FirstName,LastName,Salary

2025-01-19 15:01:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Rank,FirstName,LastName,Salary
rank1:str,firstname1:str,lastname1:str,salary1:int
rank2:str,firstname2:str,lastname2:str,salary2:int
...
```

For each faculty rank, we identified the faculty member whose salary is closest to the average salary of their respective rank and provided their rank, first name, last name, and salary. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
