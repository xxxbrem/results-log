Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Columns and their potential usage:**

- **"FacRank"**: Used to identify the rank of each faculty member; essential for grouping and calculating average salaries per rank.
- **"FacFirstName"**: Faculty members' first names; used for identifying faculty in the results.
- **"FacLastName"**: Faculty members' last names; used alongside first names for full identification.
- **"FacSalary"**: Faculty members' salaries; used to compute averages and compare individual salaries to the average salary of their rank.
- **"FacNo"**: Unique identifier for each faculty member; may be used if needed for precise identification.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Grouping by **"FacRank"** to calculate average salaries for each rank.
- Selecting faculty members where the difference between their salary and the average salary of their rank is minimal.
- Ordering results based on the absolute difference between individual salaries and the average salary for their rank.

Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
FacRank,FacFirstName,FacLastName,FacSalary
rank:str,first_name:str,last_name:str,salary:float
...
```

This table displays the university faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks, including their ranks, first names, last names, and salaries..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': {'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': ['HARDWARE_DIM_CUSTOMER', 'HARDWARE_DIM_PRODUCT', 'HARDWARE_FACT_GROSS_PRICE', 'HARDWARE_FACT_MANUFACTURING_COST', 'HARDWARE_FACT_PRE_INVOICE_DEDUCTIONS', 'HARDWARE_FACT_SALES_MONTHLY', 'SALARYDATASET', 'STAFFHOURS', 'UNIVERSITY_COURSE', 'UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT', 'UNIVERSITY_FACULTY', 'UNIVERSITY_OFFERING', 'UNIVERSITY_STUDENT', 'WEB_ACCOUNTS', 'WEB_EVENTS', 'WEB_ORDERS', 'WEB_REGION', 'WEB_SALES_REPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 15:04:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
FacRank,FacFirstName,FacLastName,FacSalary
rank:str,first_name:str,last_name:str,salary:float
...
```

This table displays the university faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks, including their ranks, first names, last names, and salaries. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
