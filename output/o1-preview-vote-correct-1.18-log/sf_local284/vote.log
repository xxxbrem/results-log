After comparing both SQL queries, I recommend using the second SQL script, `1result.sql`, for the following reasons:

1. **Handling NULL Values**: 

   - **`1result.sql`** explicitly filters out NULL values when calculating the average and standard deviation by including `WHERE "loss_rate_%" IS NOT NULL`. This ensures that the statistical calculations are accurate and not affected by missing data.
   - **`0result.sql`** does not include a condition to exclude NULL values, which might lead to inaccurate calculations if any NULL values exist in the `"loss_rate_%"` column.

2. **Efficiency**:

   - **`1result.sql`** uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) `item_categories` to assign categories ('Below', 'Within', 'Above') to each item in a single pass. This approach reduces the number of scans over the table and improves query performance.
   - **`0result.sql`** performs three separate subqueries to calculate the counts for each category, resulting in multiple scans of the same table, which is less efficient.

3. **Clarity and Maintainability**:

   - **`1result.sql`** uses a `CASE` statement within the CTE to clearly define the logic for categorizing items, making the query easier to read and maintain.
   - **`0result.sql`** uses subqueries with nested SELECT statements, which can be harder to read and maintain, especially as the complexity of the query increases.

Therefore, the second SQL script provides a more accurate, efficient, and maintainable solution for generating the summary of items' loss rates.
