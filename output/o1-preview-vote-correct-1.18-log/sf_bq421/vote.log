After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Correct Extraction of Data:**
  - The query in `1result.sql` accurately extracts the **embedding medium** and **staining substance** code meanings from the nested `SpecimenPreparationSequence` within the `SpecimenDescriptionSequence`.
  - It specifically filters for records where the `ConceptNameCodeSequence` has a `CodeMeaning` of **'Embedding medium'** for embedding mediums and **'Using substance'** for staining substances.
  
- **Ensuring Codes are from the SCT Coding Scheme:**
  - The query ensures that the codes are from the **SNOMED CT (SCT)** coding scheme by checking that the `CodingSchemeDesignator` is **'SCT'**.
  - This aligns with the task requirement to include only codes from the SCT coding scheme.
  
- **Accurate Aggregation and Counting:**
  - By using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for embedding mediums and staining substances, the query cleanly separates these datasets.
  - It performs an **inner join** on `SOPInstanceUID` to correctly match embedding mediums with their corresponding staining substances in each specimen.
  - The query then counts the **distinct SOPInstanceUIDs** for each unique pair, providing the number of occurrences as required.
  
- **Comprehensive Results Matching the Task:**
  - The output lists all unique pairs of embedding medium and staining substance code meanings, along with the number of occurrences for each pair.
  - The results are consistent with the expected data, showing pairs like **'Tissue freezing medium'** with **'hematoxylin stain'** and their corresponding counts.
  - It ensures that all relevant data from the 'SM' modality is included and accurately represented.

- **Alignment with the Task Requirements:**
  - The query fulfills all aspects of the task:
    - Lists unique pairs of embedding medium and staining substance code meanings.
    - Provides the number of occurrences for each pair.
    - Uses data from the 'SM' modality.
    - Extracts information from un-nested specimen preparation sequences.
    - Includes only codes from the SCT coding scheme.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
1result.sql
