After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is:

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Correct Date Range**: The query in `1result.sql` uses the date range from July 1, 2019 (timestamp in microseconds: `1561939200000000`) to December 31, 2019 (timestamp in microseconds: `1577836799000000`), which covers all posts made in July through December 2019. This ensures that all relevant data within the specified timeframe is included.

- **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: The query retrieves user IDs and tags from all required sections:
  - **Questions**: It selects user IDs and tags from questions posted by users within the specified ID range.
  - **Answers**: It selects user IDs from answers posted by users within the specified ID range and joins with the corresponding questions to retrieve the tags.
  - **Comments on Questions**: It selects user IDs from comments made on questions by users within the specified ID range and joins to get the tags from those questions.
  - **Comments on Answers**: It selects user IDs from comments made on answers by users within the specified ID range, joins with the answers to get the parent question IDs, and then retrieves the tags from those questions.

- **Proper Joins**:
  - The query correctly joins the `COMMENTS` table with the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table for comments on questions.
  - For comments on answers, it joins the `COMMENTS` table with the `POSTS_ANSWERS` table, and then joins with the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table to get the tags from the original questions.
  - This ensures that the tags associated with the original questions are accurately retrieved for both comments on questions and comments on answers.

- **Filtering for Non-Null Tags**: By including `WHERE combined."tags" IS NOT NULL` at the end, the query filters out any records where tags are not available. This ensures that the results include only the relevant data with associated tags, which is essential for the task.

- **Use of UNION ALL**: The use of `UNION ALL` combines the results from the different sections without removing duplicates, which is appropriate since we are selecting distinct user ID and tag combinations later.

- **Selection of Distinct Records**: The outer `SELECT DISTINCT` ensures that each unique combination of user ID and tags is included only once in the final result.

Therefore, `1result.sql` accurately fulfills the task requirements by retrieving the user IDs and associated tags for all relevant posts (questions, answers, and comments) made by users within the specified ID range during the specified date range.
