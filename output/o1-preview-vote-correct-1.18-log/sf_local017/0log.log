Begin Exploring Related Columns
Consider the following relevant tables and columns:

- **COLLISIONS**:
  - `"pcf_violation_category"`: Potential usage - identifies the primary collision factor violation category, i.e., the cause of the accident.
  - `"case_id"`: Potential usage - used to join with the **CASE_IDS** table to associate collisions with their corresponding year.
- **CASE_IDS**:
  - `"case_id"`: Potential usage - used to join with the **COLLISIONS** table.
  - `"db_year"`: Potential usage - indicates the year of the collision.

Here are at least 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

1. **Retrieve all distinct years in the data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "db_year"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CASE_IDS";
   ```

2. **Retrieve all distinct primary collision factor violation categories:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "pcf_violation_category"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS";
   ```

3. **Count the number of collisions per violation category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   GROUP BY "pcf_violation_category";
   ```

4. **Count the number of collisions per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "db_year", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CASE_IDS"
   GROUP BY "db_year";
   ```

5. **List the distinct violation categories for each year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT ci."db_year", c."pcf_violation_category"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS" c
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CASE_IDS" ci
     ON c."case_id" = ci."case_id";
   ```

6. **Count the number of collisions per violation category per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ci."db_year", c."pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS" c
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CASE_IDS" ci
     ON c."case_id" = ci."case_id"
   GROUP BY ci."db_year", c."pcf_violation_category";
   ```

7. **Retrieve the top 5 most common violation categories overall:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   GROUP BY "pcf_violation_category"
   ORDER BY "collision_count" DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

8. **Retrieve the top 5 most common violation categories for a specific year (e.g., 2018):**
   ```sql
   SELECT c."pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS" c
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CASE_IDS" ci
     ON c."case_id" = ci."case_id"
   WHERE ci."db_year" = 2018
   GROUP BY c."pcf_violation_category"
   ORDER BY "collision_count" DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

9. **List all distinct "pcf_violation_code" values:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "pcf_violation_code"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS";
   ```

10. **Count the number of collisions per "pcf_violation_code":**
    ```sql
    SELECT "pcf_violation_code", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    GROUP BY "pcf_violation_code";
    ```

11. **Find collisions with missing or unknown violation categories:**
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "pcf_violation_category" IS NULL OR "pcf_violation_category" = '';
    ```

12. **Retrieve a sample of collisions with their violation categories and years:**
    ```sql
    SELECT c."pcf_violation_category", ci."db_year"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS" c
    JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CASE_IDS" ci
      ON c."case_id" = ci."case_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Count the number of collisions per violation category where the violation code is not null:**
    ```sql
    SELECT c."pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS" c
    WHERE c."pcf_violation_code" IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY c."pcf_violation_category";
    ```

14. **Retrieve distinct collision severities:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "collision_severity"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS";
    ```

15. **Count the number of collisions per collision severity per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT ci."db_year", c."collision_severity", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS" c
    JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CASE_IDS" ci
      ON c."case_id" = ci."case_id"
    GROUP BY ci."db_year", c."collision_severity";
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution and frequency of collision causes (`"pcf_violation_category"`) across different years (`"db_year"`). By analyzing this data, one can identify patterns and any years where the most common causes differ from other years.Query:

Task: In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year
year:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The year in which the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years is identified by analyzing the `pcf_violation_category` in the `COLLISIONS` table, joined with the `db_year` in the `CASE_IDS` table. This allows us to compare the top two causes across different years to find the year where they differ..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 12:26:00 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year
year:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The year in which the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years is identified by analyzing the `pcf_violation_category` in the `COLLISIONS` table, joined with the `db_year` in the `CASE_IDS` table. This allows us to compare the top two causes across different years to find the year where they differ. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
