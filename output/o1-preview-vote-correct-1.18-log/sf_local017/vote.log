After reviewing and comparing the three provided SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct query that answers the question:

**"In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?"**

**Reasoning:**

1. **Data Scope and Completeness:**

   - **`0result.sql`** uses the `"db_year"` column from the `"CASE_IDS"` table to extract the year. The problem with this approach is that the `"db_year"` data seems limited to only a few years, specifically **2017**, **2018**, **2020**, and **2021**. This significantly restricts the analysis to these years, potentially missing variations in other years.
   
   - **`1result.sql`** extracts the year directly from the `"collision_date"` column in the `"COLLISIONS"` table, which contains data ranging from **2001** to **2021**. This provides a more comprehensive dataset for analysis across multiple years.

   - **`2result.sql`** also extracts the year from `"collision_date"`, similar to `1result.sql`, but it uses the `"primary_collision_factor"` column for causes, which is less granular than `"pcf_violation_category"` and might not capture specific causes accurately.

2. **Use of Appropriate Columns for Cause Analysis:**

   - **`1result.sql`** uses the `"pcf_violation_category"` column to identify the causes of accidents. This column provides specific categories of violations and is more suitable for identifying common causes of traffic accidents.

   - **`2result.sql`** uses `"primary_collision_factor"`, which includes general categories like "vehicle code violation" and "other than driver". This is less specific and might not effectively differentiate the causes.

3. **Methodology for Identifying Unique Years:**

   - **`1result.sql`** correctly follows these steps:
     - Calculates the top two most common causes per year using `"pcf_violation_category"`.
     - Constructs a string of the top two causes per year.
     - Counts how many years have the same combination of top two causes.
     - Identifies the years where the top two causes are unique compared to other years.
     - Outputs the years where the combination of top two causes occurred only once.

   - The query identifies **2001** as the year where the top two causes differ from those in other years, which makes sense given that traffic patterns and predominant causes of accidents can change over two decades.

4. **Limitations in Other Queries:**

   - **`0result.sql`** might incorrectly identify **2021** as the unique year due to the limited dataset and not considering earlier years for comparison.

   - **`2result.sql`** identifies **2016** as the unique year, but since it uses the less specific `"primary_collision_factor"`, the results might not be as accurate for determining specific differences in causes.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the comprehensive data coverage and appropriate use of specific cause categories, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that accurately answers the question.
