Task: Can you tell me the name of the most popular female baby in Wyoming for the year 2021, based on the proportion of female babies given that name compared to the total number of female babies given the same name across all states?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the most popular female baby name in Wyoming for the year 2021, based on the proportion of female babies given that name compared to the total number of female babies given the same name across all states, we analyze the data from the `USA_1910_CURRENT` table.

The result is:

```csv
name
name:str (Attention: answer in one row)
```

Here, `name` represents the most popular female baby name in Wyoming for 2021 under the specified criteria..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'USA_NAMES': {'USA_NAMES': ['USA_1910_2013', 'USA_1910_CURRENT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the most popular female baby name in Wyoming for the year 2021, based on the proportion of female babies given that name compared to the total number of female babies given the same name across all states, we analyze the data from the `USA_1910_CURRENT` table.
