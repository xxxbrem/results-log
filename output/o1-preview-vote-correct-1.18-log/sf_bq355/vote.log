After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct choice.

**Reason:**

- **Comprehensive Inclusion of Concepts:**
  - The query in `2result.sql` explicitly includes both the `descendant_concept_id`s from the `CONCEPT_ANCESTOR` table **and** the original `ancestor_concept_id` (`1331235`), which corresponds to Quinapril itself.
  - This ensures that **all** relevant concept IDs related to Quinapril are considered, including Quinapril and its related medications.
- **Handling Potential Data Variations:**
  - In some instances, the `CONCEPT_ANCESTOR` table may not contain a self-referential record where the `ancestor_concept_id` equals the `descendant_concept_id`.
  - By adding the original `ancestor_concept_id` to the list of concept IDs, the query ensures that any drug exposures directly referencing Quinapril are included.
- **Accurate Calculation:**
  - The query correctly calculates the percentage of participants **not using** Quinapril and its related medications by:
    - Calculating the total number of participants.
    - Identifying participants who have **not** been exposed to any of the included concept IDs.
    - Computing the percentage based on these numbers.
- **Consistent Results:**
  - The resulting percentage (`90.1207%`) matches across all queries, but `2result.sql` provides a more reliable and thorough approach due to the reasons mentioned above.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
