description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

description,"Global agricultural commodity production, supply, and distribution data by country, covering area harvested, production, imports, exports, and consumption for each commodity, provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Managed by the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), it covers a wide range of commodities, including grains, oilseeds, fruits, and vegetables. This data covers both calendar years (running from January 1st to December 31st) and marketing years. Marketing years typically begin in the month when the harvest of a particular crop starts and end before the beginning of the next year's harvest. This period can vary significantly among different crops and countries, depending on when these crops are sown and harvested. The specific starting month of the marketing year for each crop is essential because it affects how production, stocks, and trade are accounted for and compared year-over-year. Marketing years are used to better align the supply and demand statistics of a commodity with its normal production cycle. Additionally, the USDA's Export Sales Reporting (ESR) data provides weekly updates on the export sales activity of major commodities, further enhancing the understanding of market dynamics within these defined marketing years.

Each row represents a distinct timeseries, data, and value by geographic entity. Each variable is detailed in the us_department_of_agriculture_commodities_attributes table."

Foreign exchange (FX) rates are the rates at which one currency can be exchanged for another. These rates fluctuate based on various factors including economic indicators, market sentiment, political events, and global financial stability. Foreign exchange rates are crucial for international trade and finance, as they determine how much of one currency is needed to buy a unit of another currency. These rates can be floating, changing continuously based on market forces, or they might be pegged (fixed) to another major currency or basket of currencies, managed by a country's central bank. FX rates data is provided historically by FRED (pre-2000) and by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for 2000 onwards. To note, these data sources often do not publish the exchange rate every day.

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I do not have access to stock price data for January 1 to June 30, 2024. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies during that period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'FINANCE__ECONOMICS': {'CYBERSYN': ['BANK_FOR_INTERNATIONAL_SETTLEMENTS_ATTRIBUTES', 'BANK_FOR_INTERNATIONAL_SETTLEMENTS_TIMESERIES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_EMPLOYMENT_ATTRIBUTES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_EMPLOYMENT_TIMESERIES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_PRICE_ATTRIBUTES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'COMPANY_INDEX', 'COMPANY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'COMPANY_SECURITY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'CYBERSYN_DATA_CATALOG', 'CYBERSYN_FINANCIAL_ECONOMIC_INDICATORS_ATTRIBUTES', 'CYBERSYN_FINANCIAL_ECONOMIC_INDICATORS_TIMESERIES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_ATTRIBUTES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_TIMESERIES', 'FDIC_BRANCH_LOCATIONS_INDEX', 'FDIC_SUMMARY_OF_DEPOSITS_ATTRIBUTES', 'FDIC_SUMMARY_OF_DEPOSITS_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_HOUSE_PRICE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_HOUSE_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_MORTGAGE_PERFORMANCE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_MORTGAGE_PERFORMANCE_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_UNIFORM_APPRAISAL_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_UNIFORM_APPRAISAL_TIMESERIES', 'FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES', 'FINANCIAL_CFPB_COMPLAINT', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_ATTRIBUTES', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_TIMESERIES', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_VARIABLE_SERIES_ID_CROSSWALK', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_ATTRIBUTES', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_ENTITIES', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_EVENTS', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_HIERARCHY', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_TIMESERIES', 'FX_RATES_TIMESERIES', 'GEOGRAPHY_HIERARCHY', 'GEOGRAPHY_INDEX', 'GEOGRAPHY_OVERLAPS', 'GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'INTERNATIONAL_MONETARY_FUND_ATTRIBUTES', 'INTERNATIONAL_MONETARY_FUND_TIMESERIES', 'NEWYORKFED_CONSUMER_ATTRIBUTES', 'NEWYORKFED_CONSUMER_TIMESERIES', 'OECD_ATTRIBUTES', 'OECD_TIMESERIES', 'OPENFIGI_SECURITY_INDEX', 'PERMID_SECURITY_INDEX', 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY_CALENDAR', 'STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_TIMESERIES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

description,"Global agricultural commodity production, supply, and distribution data by country, covering area harvested, production, imports, exports, and consumption for each commodity, provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Managed by the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), it covers a wide range of commodities, including grains, oilseeds, fruits, and vegetables. This data covers both calendar years (running from January 1st to December 31st) and marketing years. Marketing years typically begin in the month when the harvest of a particular crop starts and end before the beginning of the next year's harvest. This period can vary significantly among different crops and countries, depending on when these crops are sown and harvested. The specific starting month of the marketing year for each crop is essential because it affects how production, stocks, and trade are accounted for and compared year-over-year. Marketing years are used to better align the supply and demand statistics of a commodity with its normal production cycle. Additionally, the USDA's Export Sales Reporting (ESR) data provides weekly updates on the export sales activity of major commodities, further enhancing the understanding of market dynamics within these defined marketing years.

Each row represents a distinct timeseries, data, and value by geographic entity. Each variable is detailed in the us_department_of_agriculture_commodities_attributes table."

Foreign exchange rates are crucial for international trade and finance, as they determine how much of one currency is needed to buy a unit of another currency. These rates can be floating, changing continuously based on market forces, or they might be pegged (fixed) to another major currency or basket of currencies, managed by a country's central bank. FX rates data is provided historically by FRED (pre-2000) and by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for 2000 onwards.

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I do not have access to stock price data for January 1 to June 30, 2024. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies during that period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

description,"Global agricultural commodity production, supply, and distribution data by country, covering area harvested, production, imports, exports, and consumption for each commodity, provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Managed by the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), it covers a wide range of commodities, including grains, oilseeds, fruits, and vegetables. This data covers both calendar years (running from January 1st to December 31st) and marketing years. Marketing years typically begin in the month when the harvest of a particular crop starts and end before the beginning of the next year's harvest. This period can vary significantly among different crops and countries, depending on when these crops are sown and harvested. The specific starting month of the marketing year for each crop is essential because it affects how production, stocks, and trade are accounted for and compared year-over-year. Marketing years are used to better align the supply and demand statistics of a commodity with its normal production cycle. Additionally, the USDA's Export Sales Reporting (ESR) data provides weekly updates on the export sales activity of major commodities, further enhancing the understanding of market dynamics within these defined marketing years.

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I do not have access to stock price data for January 1 to June 30, 2024. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies during that period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'FINANCE__ECONOMICS': {'CYBERSYN': ['BANK_FOR_INTERNATIONAL_SETTLEMENTS_ATTRIBUTES', 'BANK_FOR_INTERNATIONAL_SETTLEMENTS_TIMESERIES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_EMPLOYMENT_ATTRIBUTES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_EMPLOYMENT_TIMESERIES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_PRICE_ATTRIBUTES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'COMPANY_INDEX', 'COMPANY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'COMPANY_SECURITY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'CYBERSYN_DATA_CATALOG', 'CYBERSYN_FINANCIAL_ECONOMIC_INDICATORS_ATTRIBUTES', 'CYBERSYN_FINANCIAL_ECONOMIC_INDICATORS_TIMESERIES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_ATTRIBUTES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_TIMESERIES', 'FDIC_BRANCH_LOCATIONS_INDEX', 'FDIC_SUMMARY_OF_DEPOSITS_ATTRIBUTES', 'FDIC_SUMMARY_OF_DEPOSITS_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_HOUSE_PRICE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_HOUSE_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_MORTGAGE_PERFORMANCE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_MORTGAGE_PERFORMANCE_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_UNIFORM_APPRAISAL_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_UNIFORM_APPRAISAL_TIMESERIES', 'FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES', 'FINANCIAL_CFPB_COMPLAINT', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_ATTRIBUTES', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_TIMESERIES', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_VARIABLE_SERIES_ID_CROSSWALK', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_ATTRIBUTES', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_ENTITIES', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_EVENTS', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_HIERARCHY', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_TIMESERIES', 'FX_RATES_TIMESERIES', 'GEOGRAPHY_HIERARCHY', 'GEOGRAPHY_INDEX', 'GEOGRAPHY_OVERLAPS', 'GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'INTERNATIONAL_MONETARY_FUND_ATTRIBUTES', 'INTERNATIONAL_MONETARY_FUND_TIMESERIES', 'NEWYORKFED_CONSUMER_ATTRIBUTES', 'NEWYORKFED_CONSUMER_TIMESERIES', 'OECD_ATTRIBUTES', 'OECD_TIMESERIES', 'OPENFIGI_SECURITY_INDEX', 'PERMID_SECURITY_INDEX', 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY_CALENDAR', 'STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_TIMESERIES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I do not have access to stock price data for January 1 to June 30, 2024. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies during that period.
