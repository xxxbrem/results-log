We choose **0result.sql** as the correct SQL query because it directly joins the `LICENSES` table with the April 2022 events table, filters for approved licenses and the specified event types, and efficiently counts the total activities per repository without unnecessary subqueries. This approach makes the query more straightforward and easier to understand.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
