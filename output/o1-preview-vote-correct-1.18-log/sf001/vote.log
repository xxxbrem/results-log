After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL script that fulfills the task requirements is **`0result.sql`**.

**Reasoning:**

- **`0result.sql`** precisely filters for:
  - **U.S. postal codes**: `"COUNTRY" = 'US'`.
  - **Daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches**: `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6`.
  - **The week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year**: `"DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'"`.
- It selects the required columns: `"POSTAL_CODE"`, `"DATE_VALID_STD"`, and rounds `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"` to four decimal places as `"Snowfall Amount"`.
- It includes an **`ORDER BY`** clause to organize the results by date and postal code, enhancing readability.

**In contrast:**

- **`1result.sql`** uses a different date range (`'2023-01-22' AND '2023-01-28'`), which does not match the specified week in the task.
- **`2result.sql`** is similar to `0result.sql` but lacks the **`ORDER BY`** clause, making `0result.sql` the more complete and accurate choice.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
