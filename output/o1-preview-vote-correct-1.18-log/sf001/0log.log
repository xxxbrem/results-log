The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI': {'STANDARD_TILE': ['CLIMATOLOGY_DAY', 'FORECAST_DAY', 'HISTORY_DAY']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, I will identify the relevant tables, columns, and possible conditions for the task.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"HISTORY_DAY"` from the database `"GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"` and schema `"STANDARD_TILE"`.

  **Columns and Potential Usage:**

  - **"POSTAL_CODE"**: Used to identify each U.S. postal code.
  - **"DATE_VALID_STD"**: Used to filter records based on specific dates.
  - **"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"**: Used to find daily snowfall amounts, specifically those greater than 6 inches.
  - **"COUNTRY"**: Used to filter records to include only those from the United States.

**Possible Conditions:**

- **"COUNTRY" = 'US'**: To ensure we only consider data from the United States.
- **"DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'**: To focus on the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year.
- **"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6**: To find days with snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches.
- **"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" IS NOT NULL**: To exclude records where snowfall data is missing.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct countries in the dataset:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "COUNTRY"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

2. **Find the range of snowfall amounts:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

3. **List distinct postal codes:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "POSTAL_CODE"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

4. **List dates in the dataset:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "DATE_VALID_STD"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    ORDER BY "DATE_VALID_STD"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

5. **Check records for the United States:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "DATE_VALID_STD", "COUNTRY"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

6. **Find snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

7. **List dates within the specific week:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "DATE_VALID_STD"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    WHERE "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

8. **Check postal codes with snowfall data:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "POSTAL_CODE", "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

9. **List countries with postal codes:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "COUNTRY"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    WHERE "POSTAL_CODE" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

10. **Check snowfall amounts in the United States:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "POSTAL_CODE", "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Confirm the format of country codes:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "COUNTRY"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    WHERE "COUNTRY" ILIKE '%US%'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Check dates and snowfall amounts for the U.S.:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "DATE_VALID_STD", "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"
    FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
    WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries provide an understanding of the values in the relevant columns and help in exploring the dataset to prepare for the main task.Query:

Task: Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To find the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year (January 15 to January 21, 2023), we query the `HISTORY_DAY` table in the `GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE` schema. We filter records where `TOT_SNOWFALL_IN` is greater than 6 inches, `COUNTRY` is 'US', and `DATE_VALID_STD` falls between January 15 and January 21, 2023. The results are presented below.

```csv
Postal Code,Date,Snowfall Amount
postal_code1:str,date1:date,snowfall_amount1:float (>6)
postal_code2:str,date2:date,snowfall_amount2:float (>6)
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI': {'STANDARD_TILE': ['CLIMATOLOGY_DAY', 'FORECAST_DAY', 'HISTORY_DAY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 16:33:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year (January 15 to January 21, 2023), we query the `HISTORY_DAY` table in the `GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE` schema. We filter records where `TOT_SNOWFALL_IN` is greater than 6 inches, `COUNTRY` is 'US', and `DATE_VALID_STD` falls between January 15 and January 21, 2023. The results are presented below.

```csv
Postal Code,Date,Snowfall Amount
postal_code1:str,date1:date,snowfall_amount1:float (>6)
postal_code2:str,date2:date,snowfall_amount2:float (>6)
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
