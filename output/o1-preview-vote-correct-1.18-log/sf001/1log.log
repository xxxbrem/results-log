**Relevant Tables and Columns**

- **Table**: `GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY`

- **Columns and Potential Usage**:

  - `"POSTAL_CODE"`: To retrieve U.S. postal codes.
  - `"DATE_VALID_STD"`: To filter records for specific dates.
  - `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"`: To find daily snowfall amounts.
  - `"COUNTRY"`: To filter records to those from the United States.

- **Conditions That May Be Used**:

  - `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6.0`: To find snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches.
  - `"COUNTRY" = 'United States'`: To ensure records are from the U.S.
  - `"DATE_VALID_STD"` between specific dates (e.g., `'2023-01-15'` and `'2023-01-21'`): To filter for the desired week.

    ```sql
    SELECT "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD", "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'United States'
      AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6.0
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Retrieve dates and postal codes where snowfall was recorded:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "DATE_VALID_STD", "POSTAL_CODE"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Find average snowfall amounts per postal code during the specified week:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "POSTAL_CODE", AVG("TOT_SNOWFALL_IN") AS "AVG_SNOWFALL"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    WHERE "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
    GROUP BY "POSTAL_CODE"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Get total snowfall amounts for each postal code over the specified week:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "POSTAL_CODE", SUM("TOT_SNOWFALL_IN") AS "TOTAL_SNOWFALL"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    WHERE "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
    GROUP BY "POSTAL_CODE"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Identify dates with any recorded snowfall in the U.S.:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "DATE_VALID_STD"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'United States'
      AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 0
    ORDER BY "DATE_VALID_STD"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries can help understand the values and distributions in the relevant columns for your analysis.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT "COUNTRY"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   LIMIT 1000;
Answer:

Task: Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: During the week of January 22, 2023, to January 28, 2023, the following U.S. postal codes had daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches:

```csv
postal_code,date_valid_std,tot_snowfall_in
postal_code1:str,date1:date,snowfall1:float > 6.0
postal_code2:str,date2:date,snowfall2:float > 6.0
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI': {'STANDARD_TILE': ['CLIMATOLOGY_DAY', 'FORECAST_DAY', 'HISTORY_DAY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: During the week of January 22, 2023, to January 28, 2023, the following U.S. postal codes had daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches:

```csv
postal_code,date_valid_std,tot_snowfall_in
postal_code1:str,date1:date,snowfall1:float > 6.0
postal_code2:str,date2:date,snowfall2:float > 6.0
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-19 16:36:06 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: During the week of January 22, 2023, to January 28, 2023, the following U.S. postal codes had daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches:

```csv
postal_code,date_valid_std,tot_snowfall_in
postal_code1:str,date1:date,snowfall1:float > 6.0
postal_code2:str,date2:date,snowfall2:float > 6.0
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
