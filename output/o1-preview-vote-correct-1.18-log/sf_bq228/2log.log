Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, considering which tables and columns are relevant to the task:

**Relevant Table:**

- `LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"borough"`: Potential usage - Used to filter records for the borough of Barking and Dagenham.
- `"major_category"`: Potential usage - Used to identify and group major crime categories.
- `"value"`: Potential usage - Represents the number of incidents; can be used to count incidents in each category.
- `"year"`: Potential usage - May be used to filter data by specific years.
- `"month"`: Potential usage - May be used to filter data by specific months.
- `"minor_category"`: Potential usage - Provides more detailed crime categories within the major categories.
- `"lsoa_code"`: Potential usage - Identifies specific local areas within the borough.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham'`
- `WHERE "year" = specific_year`
- `WHERE "month" = specific_month`

Now, here are 15 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

1. ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "borough" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA;
   ```
2. ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "major_category" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA;
   ```
3. ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "minor_category" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA;
   ```
4. ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA;
   ```
5. ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "month" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA;
   ```
6. ```sql
   SELECT "major_category" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham' LIMIT 1000;
   ```
7. ```sql
   SELECT "minor_category" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham' LIMIT 1000;
   ```
8. ```sql
   SELECT "value" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham' LIMIT 1000;
   ```
9. ```sql
   SELECT "year", "month" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham' LIMIT 1000;
   ```
10. ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "lsoa_code" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham';
    ```
11. ```sql
    SELECT "major_category", "value" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham' LIMIT 1000;
    ```
12. ```sql
    SELECT "minor_category", "value" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham' LIMIT 1000;
    ```
13. ```sql
    SELECT "borough" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" ILIKE '%Barking%' LIMIT 1000;
    ```
14. ```sql
    SELECT "year", "value" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham' AND "year" = 2020 LIMIT 1000;
    ```
15. ```sql
    SELECT "month", "value" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham' AND "month" = 6 LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: Please provide a list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Here is the list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category:

```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents
major_category1:str,count1:int
major_category2:str,count2:int
major_category3:str,count3:int
```

These categories represent the most frequent types of crimes in Barking and Dagenham based on the incident counts..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

The answer format should be like: Here is the list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category:

```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents

These categories represent the most frequent types of crimes in Barking and Dagenham based on the incident counts. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
