After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer. This query correctly retrieves the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category. It uses clear column aliases `"Major_Category"` and `"Number_of_Incidents"` to make the output understandable and aligns perfectly with the task's requirements. Additionally, it avoids unnecessary data type casting, unlike `2result.sql`, which adds irrelevant decimal places.
