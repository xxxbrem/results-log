   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. Retrieve a sample of records for Barking and Dagenham:

   WHERE "borough" ILIKE '%Barking%Dagenham%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. Find all unique LSOA codes in Barking and Dagenham:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
   WHERE "borough" ILIKE '%Barking%Dagenham%' AND "year" = 2016
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. Check the sum of incidents reported in each month for Barking and Dagenham:

   ```sql
   SELECT "month", SUM("value") AS "total_incidents"
   FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA

Task: Please provide a list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents
category1:str,count1:int
category2:str,count2:int
category3:str,count3:int
```

This table lists the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
