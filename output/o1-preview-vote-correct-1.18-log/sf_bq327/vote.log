After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **I conclude that `0result.sql` is the correct answer**.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Precision in Filtering Country Data:**

   - `0result.sql` uses `"country_code" = 'RUS'` to filter records for Russia.
   - `1result.sql` uses `"country_name" ILIKE '%Russia%'`, which relies on pattern matching and could potentially include unintended records if other country names contain 'Russia' in the future.
   - Using the exact `country_code` is more precise and less error-prone than using a pattern match on `country_name`.

2. **Redundancy in NULL Checking:**

   - In SQL, the condition `"value" = 0` inherently excludes `NULL` values because any comparison with `NULL` results in `NULL`, which is treated as `FALSE` in a `WHERE` clause.
   - `1result.sql` includes an additional condition `"value" IS NOT NULL`, which is redundant when `"value" = 0` is already specified.
   - `0result.sql` is more concise without unnecessary conditions.

3. **Consistency and Simplicity:**

   - `0result.sql` directly addresses the task without extra clauses, making it straightforward and easier to understand.
   - It follows best practices by using exact matches and avoiding unnecessary conditions.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
0result.sql
```
