Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine how many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0 (excluding NULL values), we need to explore the relevant tables and columns in the database.

**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"` in the schema `"WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"` of the database `"WORLD_BANK"`.

- **Columns:**
  - `"country_code"`: To filter records for Russia.
  - `"country_name"`: To verify the country associated with the country code.
  - `"indicator_name"`: To identify the debt indicators.
  - `"indicator_code"`: To reference specific indicators.
  - `"value"`: To check for indicators with a value of 0, excluding NULLs.
  - `"year"`: To consider the time dimension if needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"country_code" = 'RUS'`: To select data for Russia.
- `"value" = 0`: To find indicators with a value of 0.
- `"value" IS NOT NULL`: To exclude NULL values.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all distinct country codes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_code"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **List all distinct country names and codes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_name", "country_code"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Verify the country code for Russia:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_code", "country_name"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
   WHERE "country_name" ILIKE '%Russia%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Retrieve all indicators for Russia:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "indicator_name"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
   WHERE "country_code" = 'RUS'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Check the range of years for available data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
   WHERE "country_code" = 'RUS'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Find indicators with a value of 0 for Russia:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "indicator_name", "year", "value"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
   WHERE "country_code" = 'RUS' AND "value" = 0
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Count NULL values in the "value" column for Russia:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_values_count
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
   WHERE "country_code" = 'RUS' AND "value" IS NULL;
   ```

8. **List all non-NULL values for Russia:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "indicator_name", "year", "value"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
   WHERE "country_code" = 'RUS' AND "value" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Count total records for Russia:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
   WHERE "country_code" = 'RUS';
   ```

10. **Group indicators by name and count occurrences for Russia:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "indicator_name", COUNT(*) AS occurrences
    FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
    WHERE "country_code" = 'RUS'
    GROUP BY "indicator_name"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries will help understand the data distribution, verify the country code for Russia, and explore the values associated with debt indicators. This exploration is essential before performing the final calculation to ensure accuracy and completeness.Query:

Task: How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_0_Value
value:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the number of debt indicators for Russia with a value of 0 (excluding NULL values), we would count the entries in the `INTERNATIONAL_DEBT` table within the `WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT` schema where `country_code` is `'RUS'` and `value` equals `0`. The result is represented as `value:int` since the exact number is not specified..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'WORLD_BANK': {'WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION': ['POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY'], 'WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_DEBT', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_EDUCATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_EDUCATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY'], 'WORLD_BANK_WDI': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'FOOTNOTES', 'INDICATORS_DATA', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIME']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_0_Value
value:int (Attention: answer in one row)

The result is represented as `value:int` since the exact number is not specified. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
