After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct query. Here's the reasoning:

- **`0result.sql`** reports the highest file count (`5189` for `.java` files) among the three queries, which suggests it correctly identifies more files that meet the criteria.
- The first query uses the `ILIKE` operator with patterns like `'%.java'`, which effectively captures all files ending with `.java`, regardless of the length of the file extension.
- It checks for directory depth by using `"path" LIKE '%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%'`, which matches paths with at least **11 slashes**, indicating a directory depth greater than 10.
- The other queries (`1result.sql` and `2result.sql`) use `SUBSTRING` to match file extensions and may be less accurate because they rely on fixed-length substrings, which might not account for variations in file extensions or filenames with additional dots.
- The discrepancy in file counts suggests that **`0result.sql`** more accurately represents the number of files with a directory depth greater than 10 for the specified file types.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
