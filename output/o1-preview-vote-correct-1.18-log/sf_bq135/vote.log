```plain
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

The task is to determine which date before 2022 had the highest total transaction amount in the Zilliqa blockchain data. We are given two candidate SQL queries (`0result.sql` and `2result.sql`) along with their results, and we need to choose the correct one that accurately answers the question.

**Comparison of the Two SQL Queries:**

1. **Date Conversion:**
   - Both queries convert `"block_timestamp"` from microseconds to a date format to group transactions by date.
     - `0result.sql` uses: `DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("block_timestamp" / 1000000)) AS "Date"`
     - `2result.sql` uses: `DATE_TRUNC('day', TO_TIMESTAMP("block_timestamp" / 1e6)) AS "Date"`
   - Both methods effectively extract the date part from the timestamp, so there is no significant difference here.

2. **Date Filter (Before 2022):**
   - `0result.sql` filters dates before '2022-01-01' by comparing the converted date directly:
     - `WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("block_timestamp" / 1000000)) < '2022-01-01'`
   - `2result.sql` filters timestamps by comparing the raw `"block_timestamp"` value:
     - `WHERE "block_timestamp" < 1640995200000000`
     - Note: `1640995200000000` is the UNIX timestamp in microseconds for '2022-01-01 00:00:00 UTC'.
   - Both methods correctly filter transactions before 2022.

3. **Transaction Amount Conditions:**
   - **`0result.sql` includes a condition to only consider positive transaction amounts:**
     - `AND "amount" > 0`
   - **`2result.sql` does not include this condition, meaning it considers all transaction amounts, including zero or negative values.**
   - Considering only positive transaction amounts is logical for calculating total transaction amounts, as zero or negative values do not contribute to the total in a meaningful way for this context.

4. **Transaction Success Conditions:**
   - Both queries filter transactions that were accepted and successful:
     - `AND "accepted" = TRUE`
     - `AND "success" = TRUE`

5. **Grouping and Ordering:**
   - Both queries group by the date and order the results to identify the date with the highest total transaction amount.
   - The `ROUND(SUM("amount"), 4)` function is used in both queries to calculate and format the total transaction amount.

**Conclusion:**

- **`0result.sql` is the correct SQL query** because it includes the crucial condition of `"amount" > 0`, ensuring that only positive transaction amounts are considered in the total. This aligns with the intention to calculate the highest total transaction amount accurately.
- **`2result.sql` lacks the `"amount" > 0` condition**, which means it might include zero or negative amounts in the total, potentially skewing the result.

**Result Validation:**

Both queries produce the same date ('2020-11-06') and total transaction amount (`55548901182319524666.0000`), indicating that zero or negative amounts may not have significantly impacted the total in this specific case. However, for accuracy and adherence to best practices, **`0result.sql` is preferable** because it explicitly filters out non-positive transaction amounts.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query to use is `0result.sql`.**
