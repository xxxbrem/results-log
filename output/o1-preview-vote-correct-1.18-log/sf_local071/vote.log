After reviewing the SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Date Parsing**: The script uses `TO_DATE("insert_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')` to reliably convert the `"insert_date"` string into a date format, ensuring accurate date comparisons.

2. **Distinct Dates per Country**: It selects distinct dates for each country, which is essential to accurately calculate consecutive date streaks without duplication.

3. **Effective Identification of Consecutive Dates**:
   - The script calculates a sequence number (`ROW_NUMBER()`) for each date per country.
   - It then uses `DATEADD` and `ROW_NUMBER()` to create a grouping identifier (`grp`) that aligns consecutive dates.
   - This method effectively groups dates into streaks of consecutive days.

4. **Correct Calculation of Streaks**:
   - By grouping on the country code and the calculated `grp`, the script counts the length of each streak.
   - It then determines the maximum streak length per country.

5. **Selection of Countries with the Longest Streak**:
   - The script finds the overall longest streak among all countries.
   - It selects all countries whose maximum streak length equals this longest streak, satisfying the requirement.

**All three scripts** (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`) produce the same result, identifying 'br' (Brazil), 'in' (India), and 'us' (United States) as the countries with the longest streaks in June 2022. However, **`2result.sql`** stands out due to its clarity, standard SQL practices, and concise implementation.
