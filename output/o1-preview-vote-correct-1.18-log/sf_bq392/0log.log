Begin Exploring Related Columns
Consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Columns and their potential usage:**

- **"stn"**: Station number, used to identify the station '723758'.
- **"year"**: Year of observation, used to select data from the year '2009'.
- **"mo"**: Month of observation, used to select data from October ('10').
- **"da"**: Day of observation, used to construct the full date.
- **"temp"**: Average temperature, used to find days with the highest average temperatures.
- **"max"**: Maximum temperature, provides additional temperature insights.
- **"min"**: Minimum temperature, provides additional temperature insights.
- **"name"**: Station name from the "STATIONS" table, for station information.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **"stn" = '723758'**: Filters data for the specific station.
- **"year" = '2009'**: Filters data from the year 2009.
- **"mo" = '10'**: Filters data from October.

Task: What are the top 3 dates in October 2009 with the highest average temperature for station number 723758, in the format YYYY-MM-DD?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Date
2009-10-DD1
2009-10-DD2
2009-10-DD3
```

To determine the top 3 dates in October 2009 with the highest average temperature for station number 723758, you would query the `GSOD2009` table for records matching the specified station and date range. After calculating the average temperatures for each day, you select the top 3 dates with the highest values, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NOAA_GSOD': {'NOAA_GSOD': ['GSOD1929', 'GSOD1930', 'GSOD1931', 'GSOD1932', 'GSOD1933', 'GSOD1934', 'GSOD1935', 'GSOD1936', 'GSOD1937', 'GSOD1938', 'GSOD1939', 'GSOD1940', 'GSOD1941', 'GSOD1942', 'GSOD1943', 'GSOD1944', 'GSOD1945', 'GSOD1946', 'GSOD1947', 'GSOD1948', 'GSOD1949', 'GSOD1950', 'GSOD1951', 'GSOD1952', 'GSOD1953', 'GSOD1954', 'GSOD1955', 'GSOD1956', 'GSOD1957', 'GSOD1958', 'GSOD1959', 'GSOD1960', 'GSOD1961', 'GSOD1962', 'GSOD1963', 'GSOD1964', 'GSOD1965', 'GSOD1966', 'GSOD1967', 'GSOD1968', 'GSOD1969', 'GSOD1970', 'GSOD1971', 'GSOD1972', 'GSOD1973', 'GSOD1974', 'GSOD1975', 'GSOD1976', 'GSOD1977', 'GSOD1978', 'GSOD1979', 'GSOD1980', 'GSOD1981', 'GSOD1982', 'GSOD1983', 'GSOD1984', 'GSOD1985', 'GSOD1986', 'GSOD1987', 'GSOD1988', 'GSOD1989', 'GSOD1990', 'GSOD1991', 'GSOD1992', 'GSOD1993', 'GSOD1994', 'GSOD1995', 'GSOD1996', 'GSOD1997', 'GSOD1998', 'GSOD1999', 'GSOD2000', 'GSOD2001', 'GSOD2002', 'GSOD2003', 'GSOD2004', 'GSOD2005', 'GSOD2006', 'GSOD2007', 'GSOD2008', 'GSOD2009', 'GSOD2010', 'GSOD2011', 'GSOD2012', 'GSOD2013', 'GSOD2014', 'GSOD2015', 'GSOD2016', 'GSOD2017', 'GSOD2018', 'GSOD2019', 'GSOD2020', 'GSOD2021', 'GSOD2022', 'GSOD2023', 'GSOD2024', 'STATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
