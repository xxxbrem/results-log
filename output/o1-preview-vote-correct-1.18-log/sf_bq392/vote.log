After comparing both SQL queries, I choose **`0result.sql`** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Portability and Compatibility:** The `0result.sql` query uses standard SQL functions `TO_DATE`, `TO_CHAR`, `CONCAT`, and `LPAD` to construct and format the date. These functions are widely supported across various SQL database systems, making the query more portable and compatible.
  
- **Function Availability:** The `1result.sql` query utilizes the `DATE_FROM_PARTS` function with type casting (`::INTEGER`), which may not be supported in all SQL environments. This function is specific to certain SQL dialects like Snowflake and might lead to compatibility issues in other databases.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is more universally applicable and less likely to encounter function availability issues.
