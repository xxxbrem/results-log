2result.sql
```

The SQL in `2result.sql` is the correct one because it uses the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to assign a unique rank to each date based on the z-score in descending order. This method accurately identifies the date with the second highest z-score, even in cases where multiple dates might share the same z-score. Using `ROW_NUMBER()` ensures that the ranking is precise and avoids potential issues with duplicate z-scores that might arise when using `LIMIT` with `OFFSET`.
