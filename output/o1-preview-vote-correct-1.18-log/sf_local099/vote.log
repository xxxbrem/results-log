After reviewing and comparing the SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that accurately answers the question.

**Reasoning:**

- **Understanding the Question:** We need to find the number of actors who have made more films with **Yash Chopra** than with any other director. This requires us to:
  - Identify all actors who have worked with Yash Chopra.
  - Count the number of films each actor has done with Yash Chopra.
  - For each actor, find the maximum number of films they have done with any other director.
  - Compare the counts to determine if the actor has worked more with Yash Chopra than with any other director.

- **Analysis of SQL Scripts:**

  **`0result.sql`:**
  - **Approach:** It fetches Yash Chopra's PID, counts the number of movies each actor has done with Yash Chopra, and compares it with the maximum number of movies they have done with other directors.
  - **Pros:** Correctly implements the required logic.
  - **Cons:** The query is somewhat verbose and includes unnecessary joins, making it less efficient.

  **`1result.sql`:**
  - **Approach:** This script:
    - Calculates the number of films each actor has done with each director (`actor_director_counts`).
    - Separates counts for Yash Chopra (`actor_yash_counts`) and other directors (`actor_other_max_counts`).
    - Uses a `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` to handle actors who may not have worked with other directors.
    - Compares the counts to determine if an actor has worked more with Yash Chopra.
  - **Pros:**
    - **Concise and Efficient:** The query is well-structured and readable.
    - **Accurate Logic:** Correctly handles actors who have only worked with Yash Chopra or have not worked with other directors.
    - **Correct Use of Aggregate Functions:** Uses `COUNT(DISTINCT mc."MID")` to accurately count unique movies.
  - **Cons:** None significant.

  **`2result.sql`:**
  - **Approach:** Similar logic but uses `COUNT(*)` instead of `COUNT(DISTINCT mc."MID")`.
  - **Pros:** Attempts to implement the required logic.
  - **Cons:**
    - **Potential Counting Errors:** Using `COUNT(*)` may lead to incorrect counts if there are duplicate entries in the `M_CAST` or `M_DIRECTOR` tables.
    - **Less Accurate:** This could overcount collaborations, leading to inaccurate results.

- **Result Comparison:**
  - All three scripts returned the same result (`107` actors).
  - However, due to the potential counting inaccuracies in `2result.sql`, it may not always provide the correct result in different datasets.

- **Conclusion:**
  - **`1result.sql`** is the most accurate and reliable script. It correctly implements the logic to find actors who have collaborated more with Yash Chopra than with any other director.
  - It handles data inconsistencies and ensures accurate counts by using `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` and proper filtering.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
