I choose **Candidate 0's SQL (0result.sql)** as the correct answer.

**Explanation:**

- **Candidate 0's SQL** directly utilizes the `MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGESPECIFIC` table to calculate the total population under 20 years old by summing the `"population"` for ages less than 20. It correctly joins with the `MIDYEAR_POPULATION` table to obtain the total midyear population for each country.
  
- **Key Points:**
  - **Accurate Data Source:** It uses `MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGESPECIFIC`, which contains population counts for each specific age, making it ideal for aggregating populations under 20.
  - **Comprehensive Summation:** By grouping only by `"country_name"` and `"midyear_population"`, it ensures that populations of both males and females are included in the total population under 20 without double-counting.
  - **Correct Calculation:** The percentage is accurately calculated by dividing the total population under 20 by the total midyear population and then multiplying by 100.
  - **Simplicity and Clarity:** The SQL is straightforward, making it easy to read and understand, which reduces the potential for errors.

- **Candidate 1's SQL** uses the `MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGE_SEX` table and sums over individual age columns. While it also produces the correct results, it is more complex due to the need to handle multiple columns (`"population_age_0"` to `"population_age_19"`) and uses `COALESCE` to handle potential `NULL` values. This complexity increases the risk of errors and makes the query less maintainable.

- **Candidate 2's SQL** is very similar to Candidate 0's SQL but might have minor differences in syntax or grouping, and it explicitly uses `NULLIF` in the percentage calculation. While it also produces the correct results, Candidate 0's SQL is more concise and achieves the same goal effectively.

**Conclusion:**

- **Candidate 0's SQL** best meets the requirements of the task by providing an accurate, efficient, and easy-to-understand query that correctly calculates the percentage of the population under 20 years old for each country in 2020.

**Output:**
