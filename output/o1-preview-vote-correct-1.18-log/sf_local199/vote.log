After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Clarity and Readability:** The SQL in **1result.sql** utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into manageable parts. This makes the query easier to read and understand.
  
- **Correctness:** The query correctly calculates the total rentals per store, year, and month, and then identifies the month with the maximum rentals for each store.

- **Maintainability:** By using CTEs, the query can be easily modified or extended in the future if needed.

- **Handles Ties Appropriately:** This query structure allows for handling cases where multiple months might have the same maximum number of rentals for a store.

**Chosen SQL File:**

```plain
1result.sql
