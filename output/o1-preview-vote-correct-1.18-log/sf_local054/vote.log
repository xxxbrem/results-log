After comparing the three SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate and correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Efficiency and Clarity**:
   - The query in `1result.sql` efficiently identifies the best-selling artist using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `BestSellingArtist`.
   - It directly joins the necessary tables to calculate the total amount spent by each customer on tracks by that artist.
   - The query groups the data by customer and filters those who spent less than $1, providing a clear and straightforward solution.

2. **Accurate Calculation**:
   - It calculates the total amount spent by each customer on tracks from the best-selling artist without unnecessary intermediate steps.
   - The use of `ROUND` ensures that the `AmountSpent` is formatted appropriately.

3. **Simplicity**:
   - The query avoids unnecessary subqueries or additional CTEs that could complicate the execution plan.
   - By keeping the query concise, it reduces potential errors and improves readability.

4. **Correct Results**:
   - The output matches the expected results, listing the first names of customers who spent less than $1 on tracks by the best-selling artist, along with the amounts they spent.

Considering these points, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query.

As per your request, here is the name of the SQL file:
