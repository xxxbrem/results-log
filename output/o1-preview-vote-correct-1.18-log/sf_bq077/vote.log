After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is **`0result.sql`**. This query accurately groups the data by both year and month using `DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_TIMESTAMP("date" / 1000000))`. By doing so, it ensures precise aggregation of motor vehicle theft incidents for each month within each year, correctly calculating the highest number of thefts in one month for each year.
