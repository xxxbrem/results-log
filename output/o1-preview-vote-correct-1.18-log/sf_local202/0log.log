**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"state"**: Used to group aliens by state to determine the alien population in each state.
- **"type"**: Indicates whether an alien is "Friendly" or "Hostile"; used to calculate the percentages of friendly and hostile aliens in each state.
- **"age"**: Used to calculate the average alien age in each state.
- **"id"**: Used as a unique identifier to count the number of aliens.
- **"aggressive"**: May provide additional insights into the aliens' behavior; potentially associated with hostility.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filtering records where **"state"** is not null or empty.
- Filtering by **"type"** to separate friendly and hostile aliens (`"type" = 'Friendly'` or `"type" = 'Hostile'`).
- Calculating average age where **"age"** is a valid number (`"age" > 0`).
- Selecting the top 10 states by alien population.
- Filtering states where the average alien age exceeds 200 years.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Retrieve distinct alien types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "type" 
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Count total aliens per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", COUNT("id") AS "alien_count"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
   GROUP BY "state"
   ORDER BY "alien_count" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Count friendly aliens per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", COUNT("id") AS "friendly_aliens"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
   WHERE "type" = 'Friendly'
   GROUP BY "state"
   ORDER BY "friendly_aliens" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Count hostile aliens per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", COUNT("id") AS "hostile_aliens"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
   WHERE "type" = 'Hostile'
   GROUP BY "state"
   ORDER BY "hostile_aliens" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Calculate average alien age per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", AVG("age") AS "average_age"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
   GROUP BY "state"
   ORDER BY "average_age" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List all states represented in the data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "state"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Identify states where average alien age exceeds 200:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", AVG("age") AS "average_age"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
   GROUP BY "state"
   HAVING AVG("age") > 200
   ORDER BY "average_age" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Analyze the "aggressive" attribute values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "aggressive"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Count aliens by "aggressive" value per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", "aggressive", COUNT("id") AS "count"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
   GROUP BY "state", "aggressive"
   ORDER BY "state", "count" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Retrieve distinct values in the "gender" column:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "gender"
    FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Count aliens per US region:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "us_region", COUNT("id") AS "alien_count"
    FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
    GROUP BY "us_region"
    ORDER BY "alien_count" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **List common occupations among aliens:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "occupation", COUNT("id") AS "alien_count"
    FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
    GROUP BY "occupation"
    ORDER BY "alien_count" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Get favorite foods of aliens:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "favorite_food", COUNT("id") AS "alien_count"
    FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
    GROUP BY "favorite_food"
    ORDER BY "alien_count" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Examine feeding frequency values:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "feeding_frequency"
    FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Fetch sample alien records to understand data structure:**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.ALIEN_DATA
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries are designed to explore the `ALIEN_DATA` table and gain insights into the distribution of aliens across states, their types, ages, and other attributes relevant to the task. By examining the results of these queries, we can better understand how to approach the original task and perform the necessary calculations.Query:

Task: For alien data, how many of the top 10 states by alien population have a higher percentage of friendly aliens than hostile aliens, with an average alien age exceeding 200?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_states
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine this number, we analyze the `ALIEN_DATA` table to find the top 10 states by alien population. For each of these states, we calculate the percentage of friendly and hostile aliens and the average alien age. The number of states where the percentage of friendly aliens is higher than hostile aliens, with an average alien age exceeding 200, is reported as `num:int` in the table above..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CITY_LEGISLATION': {'CITY_LEGISLATION': ['ALIENS', 'ALIENS_DETAILS', 'ALIENS_LOCATION', 'ALIEN_DATA', 'CITIES', 'CITIES_COUNTRIES', 'CITIES_CURRENCIES', 'CITIES_LANGUAGES', 'JOB_COMPANY', 'JOB_POSTINGS_FACT', 'LEGISLATION_DATE_DIM', 'LEGISLATORS', 'LEGISLATORS_TERMS', 'SKILLS_DIM', 'SKILLS_JOB_DIM']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 15:30:13 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For alien data, how many of the top 10 states by alien population have a higher percentage of friendly aliens than hostile aliens, with an average alien age exceeding 200?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Number_of_states
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine this number, we analyze the `ALIEN_DATA` table to find the top 10 states by alien population. For each of these states, we calculate the percentage of friendly and hostile aliens and the average alien age. The number of states where the percentage of friendly aliens is higher than hostile aliens, with an average alien age exceeding 200, is reported as `num:int` in the table above. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
