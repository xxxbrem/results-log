After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **2result.sql** is the correct SQL query for the given task.

**Reasoning:**

All three SQL queries aim to calculate the number of the top 10 states by alien population where:

- The number of friendly aliens is greater than the number of hostile aliens.
- The average alien age exceeds 200 years.

While all three queries produce the same result of **5** states, **2result.sql** is the most accurate and well-structured solution. Here's why:

1. **Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**  
   The query in **2result.sql** utilizes CTEs to break down the problem into logical, manageable parts:
   - **`top_states` CTE:** Selects the top 10 states by alien population.
   - **`state_stats` CTE:** Calculates the number of friendly and hostile aliens and the average age for each of these top states.
   - **`final_states` CTE:** Filters the states that meet the criteria of having more friendly aliens than hostile ones and an average age exceeding 200.

2. **Clarity and Readability:**  
   By structuring the query with CTEs, **2result.sql** enhances readability and makes it easier to understand each step of the computation. This modular approach clearly separates data retrieval, aggregation, and filtering processes.

3. **Accurate Implementation of Requirements:**  
   The query correctly implements all the conditions specified in the task:
   - **Top 10 states by alien population:** It selects the top 10 states using the `ORDER BY total_aliens DESC` clause.
   - **Friendly vs. Hostile Aliens:** It computes the counts of friendly and hostile aliens using conditional aggregation and applies the `friendly_aliens > hostile_aliens` condition.
   - **Average Age Exceeding 200:** It calculates the average age per state and applies the `avg_age > 200` condition.

4. **Best SQL Practices:**  
   The use of CTEs and clear naming conventions in **2result.sql** adhere to best SQL practices, making the query maintainable and scalable for future modifications.

5. **Consistency with the Task Objective:**  
   The query directly addresses the task's requirements without unnecessary complexity or potential errors that could arise from nested subqueries or improper use of `WHERE` clauses in the other options.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
2result.sql
