After comparing the two SQL queries, **`0result.sql`** is the correct choice because it comprehensively checks for the absence of references in all relevant columns. It ensures that the images selected have no references to other series, images, or sources by verifying that all reference-related columns are either `NULL`, empty, or contain no data. This aligns precisely with the task requirements.

On the other hand, **`2result.sql`** only checks a subset of reference columns (`"ReferencedSeriesSequence"`, `"ReferencedImageSequence"`, and `"SourceImageSequence"`). This means it might include images that still have references in other columns not accounted for in the query, such as `"ReferencedSOPInstanceUIDInFile"`, `"ReferencedSOPClassUID"`, `"ReferencedImageEvidenceSequence"`, `"SourceIrradiationEventSequence"`, and `"ReferencedRawDataSequence"`.

By using **`0result.sql`**, we ensure that all images returned truly have no references, providing accurate results for the size calculations and viewer URLs as requested.
