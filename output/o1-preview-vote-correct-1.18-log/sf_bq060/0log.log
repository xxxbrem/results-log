**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **Table:** `COUNTRY_NAMES_AREA`
  - `"country_code"`: To join with other tables based on country codes.
  - `"country_name"`: To identify the names of countries.
  - `"country_area"`: To filter countries with an area greater than 500 square kilometers.

- **Table:** `BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES`
  - `"country_code"`: To join with other tables based on country codes.
  - `"country_name"`: To identify the names of countries.
  - `"year"`: To filter records for the year 2017.
  - `"net_migration"`: To obtain net migration values for each country.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"country_area" > 500`: To select countries with an area greater than 500 square kilometers.
- `"year" = 2017`: To focus on data from the year 2017.
- `"net_migration" IS NOT NULL`: To include only records where net migration data is available.

4. **List all distinct years available in the `BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Retrieve net migration data for all countries in the year 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "net_migration"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES
   WHERE "year" = 2017
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Find countries with available net migration data in 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "net_migration"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES
   WHERE "year" = 2017 AND "net_migration" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List all countries and their net migration rates for 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "net_migration"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES
   WHERE "year" = 2017

Task: Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of 2017, the top 3 countries with the highest net migration rates among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers are:

```csv
Country_Name,Net_Migration_Rate
Qatar,18.2
United Arab Emirates,11.7
Oman,9.7
```

These net migration rates are expressed per 1,000 inhabitants. The high net migration rates in these countries are largely due to significant immigration driven by economic opportunities in sectors like oil, gas, and construction..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL': {'CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL': ['AGE_SPECIFIC_FERTILITY_RATES', 'BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES', 'COUNTRY_NAMES_AREA', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION_5YR_AGE_SEX', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGESPECIFIC', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGE_SEX', 'MORTALITY_LIFE_EXPECTANCY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 22:49:30 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: As of 2017, the top 3 countries with the highest net migration rates among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers are:

```csv
Country_Name,Net_Migration_Rate
Qatar,18.2
United Arab Emirates,11.7
Oman,9.7
```

These net migration rates are expressed per 1,000 inhabitants. The high net migration rates in these countries are largely due to significant immigration driven by economic opportunities in sectors like oil, gas, and construction. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
