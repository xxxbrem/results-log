After comparing both SQL queries and their results, the first query (`0result.sql`) is the correct one. It includes an explicit condition to exclude null values in the `"net_migration"` column, ensuring that only countries with available net migration data are considered. This makes the query more precise for determining the top countries with the highest net migration rates.
