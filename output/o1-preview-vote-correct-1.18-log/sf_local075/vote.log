```plain
2result.sql
```

I chose **2result.sql** because it fulfills the task requirements by providing a detailed breakdown for each product, including:

- **Number of times each product was viewed** (`views`).
- **Number of times each product was added to the shopping cart** (`additions_to_cart`).
- **Number of times each product was left in the cart without being purchased** (`left_in_cart_without_purchase`).
- **Count of actual purchases for each product** (`actual_purchases`).

The SQL query accurately filters out the specified `page_id`s (1, 2, 12, 13) and ensures that only relevant products are included. It also joins the necessary tables and calculates the counts based on `visit_id`, which correctly associates events within the same user session.
