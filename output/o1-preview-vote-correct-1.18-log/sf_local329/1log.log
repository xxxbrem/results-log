Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions to understand the data. Then, we'll construct SQL queries to explore the values in these columns.

### **Relevant Tables and Columns**

1. **Table:** `FORM_LOG`

   - **Column:** `"session"`  
     **Potential Usage:** Identify unique sessions.
   - **Column:** `"path"`  
     **Potential Usage:** Determine the pages visited (e.g., `/regist/input`, `/regist/confirm`).
   - **Column:** `"stamp"`  
     **Potential Usage:** Establish the order of page visits by timestamp.
   - **Conditions:** Filter records where `"path"` is `/regist/input` or `/regist/confirm` and sort by `"stamp"` to analyze the sequence.

2. **Table:** `READ_LOG`

   - **Column:** `"session"`  
     **Potential Usage:** Identify unique sessions.
   - **Column:** `"url"`  
     **Potential Usage:** Determine accessed URLs containing registration pages.
   - **Column:** `"stamp"`  
     **Potential Usage:** Establish the sequence of URL accesses.
   - **Conditions:** Filter records where `"url"` includes `/regist` patterns.

3. **Table:** `ACTIVITY_LOG`

   - **Column:** `"session"`  
     **Potential Usage:** Identify unique sessions.
   - **Column:** `"path"`  
     **Potential Usage:** Determine the activity paths related to registration.
   - **Column:** `"stamp"`  
     **Potential Usage:** Establish the timeline of activities.
   - **Conditions:** Filter records where `"path"` includes `/regist` patterns.

### **Exploratory SQL Queries**

1. **Query 1:** Retrieve distinct paths from `FORM_LOG` to identify available pages.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "path"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Query 2:** Fetch sample records where `"path"` is `/regist/input` to see sessions accessing the input page.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   WHERE "path" = '/regist/input'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Query 3:** Fetch sample records where `"path"` is `/regist/confirm` to see sessions accessing the confirm page.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   WHERE "path" = '/regist/confirm'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Query 4:** List distinct sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   WHERE "path" = '/regist/input'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Query 5:** List distinct sessions that visited the `/regist/confirm` page.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   WHERE "path" = '/regist/confirm'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Query 6:** Retrieve timestamps and paths for a sample session to analyze page visit order.

   ```sql
   SELECT "stamp", "path"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   WHERE "session" = '<sample_session_id>'
   ORDER BY "stamp"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   *(Replace `<sample_session_id>` with an actual session ID from previous queries.)*

7. **Query 7:** Identify sessions that visited both `/regist/input` and `/regist/confirm` pages.

   ```sql
   SELECT "session"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   WHERE "path" IN ('/regist/input', '/regist/confirm')
   GROUP BY "session"
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "path") = 2
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Query 8:** Get timestamps for sessions visiting `/regist/input` to understand when the page is accessed.

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   WHERE "path" = '/regist/input'
   ORDER BY "stamp"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Query 9:** Get timestamps for sessions visiting `/regist/confirm` to understand follow-up actions.

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   WHERE "path" = '/regist/confirm'
   ORDER BY "stamp"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Query 10:** Count the total number of unique sessions in `FORM_LOG`.

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "session") AS "total_sessions"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Query 11:** List sessions and their actions from `FORM_LOG` to understand user interactions.

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "action", "path", "stamp"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
    ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Query 12:** Retrieve distinct `"action"` values to understand possible actions.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "action"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Query 13:** Fetch records from `READ_LOG` where `"url"` contains `/regist` to explore related logs.

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."READ_LOG"
    WHERE "url" ILIKE '%/regist%'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Query 14:** List distinct `"path"` entries from `ACTIVITY_LOG` related to registration.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "path"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    WHERE "path" ILIKE '%/regist%'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Query 15:** Identify sessions in `FORM_LOG` with successful status, if applicable.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "session"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
    WHERE "status" = 'success'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

16. **Query 16:** Retrieve samples of `"status"` values to understand their meanings.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "status"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

17. **Query 17:** Find sessions that accessed pages with paths containing `/regist` in `FORM_LOG`.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "session"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
    WHERE "path" ILIKE '%/regist%'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

18. **Query 18:** Check for any error logs related to registration in `FORM_ERROR_LOG`.

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_ERROR_LOG"
    WHERE "form" ILIKE '%regist%'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

19. **Query 19:** Get the range of timestamps in `FORM_LOG` to understand the logging period.

    ```sql
    SELECT MIN("stamp") AS "earliest_stamp", MAX("stamp") AS "latest_stamp"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

20. **Query 20:** Retrieve the number of times each session accessed `/regist/input`.

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", COUNT(*) AS "input_visit_count"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
    WHERE "path" = '/regist/input'
    GROUP BY "session"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries are designed to explore and understand the values in the relevant columns of the `FORM_LOG`, `READ_LOG`, and `ACTIVITY_LOG` tables. By examining the sessions, paths, and timestamps, we can gain insights into user navigation patterns, which is essential for addressing the original task.Query:

Task: How many unique sessions visited the /regist/input page and then the /regist/confirm page, in that order?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page followed by the `/regist/confirm` page in that specific order, we use the `FORM_LOG` table, which contains session information along with the paths accessed.

```csv
unique_sessions
number:int >= 0 (Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'FORM_LOG', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_USERS', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'PRODUCT_SALES', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'READ_LOG']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page followed by the `/regist/confirm` page in that specific order, we use the `FORM_LOG` table, which contains session information along with the paths accessed.

```csv
unique_sessions
number:int >= 0 (Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
