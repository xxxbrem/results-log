```

This query adjusts for the timestamp formatting by converting the `"stamp"` column from `VARCHAR` to `TIMESTAMP` using the `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP` function with the format `'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'`. This ensures that the timestamp comparisons work correctly.

- **Explanation:**
  - We select sessions that have both `/regist/input` and `/regist/confirm` paths.
  - Convert the `"stamp"` strings to timestamps for accurate comparison.
  - Check that both `input_time` and `confirm_time` are not null.
  - Ensure that `input_time` occurred before `confirm_time`.

   - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the action; used to order actions.
   - `"action"`: Contains the action or page visited; potentially includes `/regist/input` and `/regist/confirm`.

2. **LOG.LOG.ACTION_LOG**
   - `"session"`: Identifies the user session.
   - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the action.
   - `"action"`: Contains the action or page visited.

3. **LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG**
   - `"session"`: Identifies the user session.
   - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the action.
   - `"action"`: Describes the action performed.
   - `"path"`: May contain the page path; potentially includes `/regist/input` and `/regist/confirm`.

4. **LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG**
   - `"session"`: Identifies the user session.
   - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the action.
   - `"action"`: Describes the form action.
   - `"path"`: Contains the page path; likely includes `/regist/input` and `/regist/confirm`.

5. **LOG.LOG.READ_LOG**
   - `"session"`: Identifies the user session.
   - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the action.
   - `"url"`: Contains the URL accessed; potentially includes `/regist/input` and `/regist/confirm`.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter records where `"action"`, `"path"`, or `"url"` contains `/regist/input` or `/regist/confirm`.
- Use `"stamp"` to order actions and determine the sequence within sessions.
- Identify sessions where `/regist/input` is accessed before `/regist/confirm`.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. Retrieve distinct actions from **ACCESS_LOG**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "action" FROM LOG.LOG.ACCESS_LOG LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. Get distinct paths from **ACTIVITY_LOG**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "path" FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. Fetch records from **FORM_LOG** where `"path"` includes `/regist`:

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp", "path" 
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG 
   WHERE "path" LIKE '%/regist%' 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. Identify sessions in **READ_LOG** that accessed `/regist/input`:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session" 
   FROM LOG.LOG.READ_LOG 
   WHERE "url" LIKE '%/regist/input%' 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. Retrieve session actions related to registration from **ACCESS_LOG**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp", "action" 
   FROM LOG.LOG.ACCESS_LOG 
   WHERE "action" LIKE '%/regist%' 
   ORDER BY "session", "stamp" 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. List actions containing 'regist' from **ACTION_LOG**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "action" 
   FROM LOG.LOG.ACTION_LOG 
   WHERE "action" LIKE '%regist%' 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. Get sessions and paths from **ACTIVITY_LOG** where `"path"` is `/regist/input`:

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp", "path" 
   FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG 
   WHERE "path" = '/regist/input' 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. Check the format of `"stamp"` in **FORM_LOG**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "stamp" 
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. Find sessions from **ACCESS_LOG** where `"action"` is `/regist/confirm`:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session" 
   FROM LOG.LOG.ACCESS_LOG 
   WHERE "action" = '/regist/confirm' 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. Retrieve URLs containing '/regist' from **READ_LOG**:

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "stamp", "url" 
    FROM LOG.LOG.READ_LOG 
    WHERE "url" LIKE '%/regist%' 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. Fetch sessions and actions from **FORM_LOG**:

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "action", "path" 
    FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. List actions and paths from **ACTIVITY_LOG**:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "action", "path" 
    FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. Get the count of each action type in **FORM_LOG**:

    ```sql
    SELECT "action", COUNT(*) 
    FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG 
    GROUP BY "action" 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. Retrieve sessions where `"path"` is `/regist/confirm` from **ACTIVITY_LOG**:

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "stamp", "path" 
    FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG 
    WHERE "path" = '/regist/confirm' 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. Identify sessions that visited `/regist/input` in **ACCESS_LOG**:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "session" 
    FROM LOG.LOG.ACCESS_LOG 
    WHERE "action" = '/regist/input' 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

16. Examine distinct `"url"` patterns in **READ_LOG**:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "url" 
    FROM LOG.LOG.READ_LOG 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help explore the data to understand which tables and columns contain the necessary information to determine the number of unique sessions that visited `/regist/input` followed by `/regist/confirm`.Query:

Task: How many unique sessions visited the /regist/input page and then the /regist/confirm page, in that order?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
number_of_unique_sessions
num:int > 0
```
This represents the count of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page followed by the `/regist/confirm` page, in that specific order..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'FORM_LOG', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_USERS', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'PRODUCT_SALES', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'READ_LOG']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive and negative signs.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
number_of_unique_sessions
num:int > 0
```
This represents the count of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page followed by the `/regist/confirm` page, in that specific order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
