**Analysis of the SQL Queries and Results:**

The task is to **provide the highest and lowest profits for Italian customers segmented into ten evenly divided tiers based on their December 2021 sales profits**. This requires calculating the **total profit per customer** for December 2021 sales, then segmenting these customers into ten tiers based on their profits.

Let's analyze each SQL query to determine which one correctly accomplishes this task.

---

### **1. 0result.sql**

**Summary:**

- Calculates **profit per sale transaction**.
- Segments individual sale transactions into ten tiers based on their profits.
- Uses `NTILE(10)` over individual profits.

**SQL Highlights:**

```sql
SELECT
  "Tier",
  ROUND(MAX(profit), 4) AS "Highest_Profit",
  ROUND(MIN(profit), 4) AS "Lowest_Profit"
FROM (
  SELECT
    NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY profit DESC NULLS LAST) AS "Tier",
    profit
  FROM (
    SELECT
      s."cust_id",
      ROUND(s."amount_sold" - cst."unit_cost" * s."quantity_sold", 4) AS profit
    FROM "SALES" s
    -- Joins and filters for Italian customers in December 2021
  ) profit_data
) tiered_profits
GROUP BY "Tier"
ORDER BY "Tier";
```

**Why It Doesn't Meet the Requirements:**

- **Segments Sale Transactions Instead of Customers:** The query segments individual sales transactions, not customers. The task requires segmenting **customers** based on their total profits.
- **Profit Calculated Per Transaction:** While profit per transaction is calculated, it isn't aggregated per customer.

### **2. 2result.sql**

**Summary:**

- Calculates **total profit per customer**.
- Uses the **average unit cost** per product across all time to calculate profits.
- Segments customers into ten tiers based on their total profits.

**SQL Highlights:**

```sql
WITH Italian_Customers AS (
  -- Retrieves Italian customers
),
December2021Sales AS (
  -- Retrieves sales from December 2021
),
Italian_December2021Sales AS (
  -- Joins to get sales of Italian customers in Dec 2021
),
Avg_Costs AS (
  SELECT
    "prod_id",
    AVG("unit_cost") AS "avg_unit_cost"
  FROM "COSTS"
  GROUP BY "prod_id"
),
Sales_With_Profit AS (
  SELECT
    s."cust_id",
    -- Calculates profit using average unit cost
    (s."amount_sold" - s."quantity_sold" * ac."avg_unit_cost") AS "profit"
  FROM Italian_December2021Sales s
  LEFT JOIN Avg_Costs ac ON s."prod_id" = ac."prod_id"
),
Customer_Profit AS (
  -- Sums profit per customer
),
Customer_Tiers AS (
  -- Uses NTILE(10) over total profit per customer
)
SELECT
  "profit_tier" AS "Profit_Tier",
  ROUND(MIN("total_profit"), 4) AS "Lowest_Profit",
  ROUND(MAX("total_profit"), 4) AS "Highest_Profit"
FROM Customer_Tiers
GROUP BY "profit_tier"
ORDER BY "profit_tier";
```

**Why It's Not the Best Choice:**

- **Uses Average Unit Cost:** The profit calculation uses the average unit cost per product across all time, not the actual unit cost at the time of each sale.
- **Potentially Inaccurate Profits:** This method can lead to inaccurate profit calculations because it doesn't account for cost variations over time.

### **3. 1result.sql**

**Summary:**

- Calculates **total profit per customer** using the **actual unit cost at the time of each sale**.
- Segments customers into ten tiers based on their total profits.
- Accurately reflects profits for Italian customers in December 2021.

**SQL Highlights:**

```sql
WITH italy_country_id AS (
  -- Retrieves country_id for Italy
),
italian_customers AS (
  -- Retrieves Italian customers
),
times_dec2021 AS (
  -- Retrieves time_ids for December 2021
),
italian_sales_dec2021 AS (
  -- Retrieves sales of Italian customers in Dec 2021
),
sales_with_costs AS (
  SELECT S.*, C."unit_cost"
  FROM italian_sales_dec2021 S
  LEFT JOIN "COSTS" C
    ON S."prod_id" = C."prod_id" AND S."time_id" = C."time_id"
),
sales_with_profit AS (
  -- Calculates profit per sale using actual unit cost at time of sale
  SELECT S.*, ROUND(S."amount_sold" - COALESCE(S."unit_cost", 0) * S."quantity_sold", 4) as profit
  FROM sales_with_costs S
),
customer_profits AS (
  -- Sums profit per customer
),
customer_profits_with_tier AS (
  -- Uses NTILE(10) over total profit per customer
)
SELECT 
  CPWT.Tier,
  ROUND(MAX(CPWT.total_profit), 4) as Highest_Profit,
  ROUND(MIN(CPWT.total_profit), 4) as Lowest_Profit
FROM customer_profits_with_tier CPWT
GROUP BY CPWT.Tier
ORDER BY CPWT.Tier;
```

**Why It's the Correct Choice:**

- **Calculates Total Profit Per Customer:** It sums up profits per customer, which aligns with the task requirement to segment customers.
- **Uses Actual Unit Cost at Time of Sale:** By joining on both "prod_id" and "time_id", it ensures that the unit cost corresponds to the time of sale, leading to accurate profit calculations.
- **Segments Customers into Tiers Based on Total Profit:** Uses `NTILE(10)` over the total profit per customer to segment them into ten evenly divided tiers.
- **Meets All Task Requirements:** This query accurately calculates the highest and lowest profits for Italian customers in December 2021, segmented into ten tiers based on their total sales profits.

**Conclusion:**

After analyzing all three SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** correctly fulfills the task requirements by calculating the total profits per customer using accurate unit costs and segmenting Italian customers into ten tiers based on their December 2021 sales profits.
