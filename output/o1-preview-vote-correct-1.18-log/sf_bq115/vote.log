After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries provided, here's the analysis:

**Option 0 (0result.sql):**

- **Data Source:** Uses only the `MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGESPECIFIC` table.
- **Method:** Calculates the percentage by summing the population under age 25 and dividing it by the total sum of the age-specific populations for each country.
- **Potential Issue:** The total population calculated from the age-specific data may not match the official total midyear population due to discrepancies or missing age cohorts. This can lead to inaccurate percentages.

**Option 1 (1result.sql):**

- **Data Sources:** Uses both the `MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGESPECIFIC` and `MIDYEAR_POPULATION` tables.
- **Method:**
  - **Numerator:** Sums the population under age 25 from the age-specific data.
  - **Denominator:** Uses the official total midyear population from the `MIDYEAR_POPULATION` table.
  - **Join Condition:** Joins the two datasets on `country_code`, which is a unique and consistent identifier.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Accuracy:** By using the official midyear population as the denominator, the calculation accounts for any discrepancies or missing data in the age-specific population sums.
  - **Reliable Join:** Joining on `country_code` reduces the risk of mismatches due to variations in country names.

**Option 2 (2result.sql):**

- **Data Sources:** Also uses both the `MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGESPECIFIC` and `MIDYEAR_POPULATION` tables.
- **Method:**
  - Similar to Option 1 but joins the datasets on `country_name`.
- **Potential Issue:**
  - **Join Reliability:** Joining on `country_name` can introduce errors if there are inconsistencies in country naming conventions between the two tables (e.g., differences in spelling, punctuation, or naming standards like "Bahamas, The").

**Conclusion:**

Option **1result.sql** is the most accurate and reliable query because it:

- Uses the official total population as the denominator, ensuring the percentage is based on authoritative data.
- Joins tables using `country_code`, minimizing the risk of join errors due to naming inconsistencies.
- Provides a precise calculation of the percentage of the population under age 25 for each country.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
1result.sql
