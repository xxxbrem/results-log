After comparing the three SQL queries, I conclude that **2result.sql** is the correct answer. Here is the reasoning:

- **Date Construction**: In **2result.sql**, the `DATE_FROM_PARTS("year", "month", "day")` function is used to construct the date directly from the year, month, and day components. This approach ensures that the date is correctly formed regardless of whether the month or day values are single or double digits. In contrast, **0result.sql** and **1result.sql** use string concatenation and may not handle single-digit months and days properly unless leading zeros are accounted for, which **0result.sql** does not do.

- **Grouping and Aggregation**: All three queries group the data by date, latitude, and longitude to calculate the average wind speed per day per location. However, **2result.sql** simplifies the grouping by directly grouping on the constructed date, latitude, and longitude.

- **Data Filtering**: All queries correctly filter out records with missing wind speed values and limit the data to the years between 2005 and 2015.

- **Function Usage**: By using the `DATE_FROM_PARTS` function, **2result.sql** enhances code readability and reliability.

Therefore, **2result.sql** is the most accurate and reliable query that fulfills the requirements.
