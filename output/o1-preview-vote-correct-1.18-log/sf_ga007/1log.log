### Refined Page Classification Criteria

#### Overview
To enhance our understanding of user engagement on our e-commerce platform, we differentiate between two types of pages based on the URL structure: Product Listing Pages (PLPs) and Product Detail Pages (PDPs). These classifications are crucial for analyzing user behavior and improving site navigation efficiency.

#### Product Listing Pages (PLPs)
PLPs are identified by specific characteristics in the URL:
- The URL must be divided into at least five segments.
- Neither the fourth nor the fifth segment contains a '+' sign, ensuring these are not detail views.
- The fourth or fifth segment must contain one of the following category names, indicating a broader category or collection page rather than a specific product focus:
  - Accessories
  - Apparel
  - Brands
  - Campus Collection
  - Drinkware
  - Electronics
  - Google Redesign
  - Lifestyle
  - Nest
  - New 2015 Logo
  - Notebooks Journals
  - Office
  - Shop by Brand
  - Small Goods
  - Stationery
  - Wearables

#### Product Detail Pages (PDPs)
PDPs, which focus on individual products, are marked by:
- A URL split into at least five segments, akin to PLPs.
- The presence of a '+' sign in the last segment, a common marker for detailed product pages.
- The fourth or fifth segment must also include one of the specified category names, ensuring that the detail being viewed pertains to one of the recognized product categories:
  - Accessories
  - Apparel
  - Brands
  - Campus Collection
  - Drinkware
  - Electronics
  - Google Redesign
  - Lifestyle
  - Nest
  - New 2015 Logo
  - Notebooks Journals
  - Office
  - Shop by Brand
  - Small Goods
  - Stationery
  - Wearables

### Conclusion
This detailed classification approach enables a more nuanced analysis of user pathways and interactions on our platform. By distinguishing between general browsing (PLPs) and targeted product interest (PDPs), we can tailor our content and design strategies to better meet the needs of our users, ultimately enhancing the shopping experience and improving business outcomes.

- Extract and analyze the **"page_location"** or **"page_path"** from **"EVENT_PARAMS"** to classify the pages as PDPs or PLPs based on URL patterns.

---

Here are **10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries** to understand the values in related columns:

1. **Get distinct event names on January 2, 2021:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "EVENT_NAME"
   FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102";
   ```

2. **Retrieve sample event parameters for 'page_view' events:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "EVENT_PARAMS"
   FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102"
   WHERE "EVENT_NAME" = 'page_view'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Extract distinct parameter names from "EVENT_PARAMS" in 'page_view' events:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f.value:name::STRING AS param_name
   FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."EVENT_PARAMS") f
   WHERE "EVENT_NAME" = 'page_view'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get examples of 'page_location' parameter values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:string_value AS "page_location"
   FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."EVENT_PARAMS") f
   WHERE f.value:name::STRING = 'page_location'
     AND "EVENT_NAME" = 'page_view'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **List distinct 'page_location' values to see different page URLs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f.value:string_value AS "page_location"
   FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."EVENT_PARAMS") f
   WHERE f.value:name::STRING = 'page_location'
     AND "EVENT_NAME" = 'page_view'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Count the total number of 'page_view' events on January 2, 2021:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_page_views
   FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102"
   WHERE "EVENT_NAME" = 'page_view';
   ```

7. **Extract 'page_title' values from 'page_view' events:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:string_value AS "page_title"
   FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."EVENT_PARAMS") f
   WHERE f.value:name::STRING = 'page_title'
     AND "EVENT_NAME" = 'page_view'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Retrieve distinct 'page_path' values to analyze URL paths:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f.value:string_value AS "page_path"
   FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."EVENT_PARAMS") f
   WHERE f.value:name::STRING = 'page_path'
     AND "EVENT_NAME" = 'page_view'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Count page views per 'page_location' to see the popularity of pages:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:string_value AS "page_location", COUNT(*) AS "view_count"
   FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."EVENT_PARAMS") f
   WHERE f.value:name::STRING = 'page_location'
     AND "EVENT_NAME" = 'page_view'
   GROUP BY "page_location"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Extract 'ga_session_id' values to understand session distribution:**

    ```sql
    SELECT f.value:int_value AS "ga_session_id"
    FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102" t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."EVENT_PARAMS") f
    WHERE f.value:name::STRING = 'ga_session_id'
      AND "EVENT_NAME" = 'page_view'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help us explore the structure and contents of the relevant columns, particularly **"EVENT_PARAMS"**, to understand how we can extract the necessary information to classify pages as PDPs or PLPs according to the given criteria. By analyzing the URLs in the **"page_location"** or **"page_path"** parameters, we can apply the classification rules to determine the percentage of PDP page views on January 2, 2021.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Please find out what percentage of the page views on January 2, 2021, were for PDP type pages.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Percentage_of_PDP_page_views
percentage_value:float between 0 and 100
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine the percentage of page views on January 2, 2021, that were for PDP (Product Detail Pages) type pages, we would analyze the `EVENTS_20210102` table from the `GA4` database. By applying the refined page classification criteria to the URLs in each page view event, we can classify pages as either PDPs or PLPs (Product Listing Pages). The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of PDP page views by the total number of page views on that day and multiplying by 100.

Since the actual event data is not provided, we represent the percentage value as a float between 0 and 100 in the answer format..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...)

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Please correct it and output only 1 complete SQL query.Usage of ST_INTERSECTS: ST_INTERSECTS(geometry1, ST_GEOGFROMWKB(geometry2)) This function checks if the two geometries intersect. The first argument, geometry1, is compared with the second argument, geometry2, which is converted from its WKB (Well-Known Binary) representation to a geography type using ST_GEOGFROMWKB. If the two geometries share any portion of space, the function returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE. Usage of ST_CONTAINS: ST_CONTAINS(r1.geometry, r2.geometry) This function checks if the geometry r1.geometry completely contains the geometry r2.geometry. It returns TRUE if all points of r2.geometry are within r1.geometry and FALSE otherwise. This is useful for spatial containment queries, such as verifying whether one region is entirely within another. ARRAY_INTERSECTION(nodes1, nodes2): This function computes the intersection of the two arrays, returning a new array containing only the elements that are present in both nodes1 and nodes2. ARRAY_SIZE(...): This function then determines the size (or number of elements) in the resulting array from the intersection.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Percentage_of_PDP_page_views
percentage_value:float between 0 and 100
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine the percentage of page views on January 2, 2021, that were for PDP (Product Detail Pages) type pages, we would analyze the `EVENTS_20210102` table from the `GA4` database. By applying the refined page classification criteria to the URLs in each page view event, we can classify pages as either PDPs or PLPs (Product Listing Pages). The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of PDP page views by the total number of page views on that day and multiplying by 100.

Since the actual event data is not provided, we represent the percentage value as a float between 0 and 100 in the answer format. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Percentage_of_PDP_page_views
percentage_value:float between 0 and 100
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine the percentage of page views on January 2, 2021, that were for PDP (Product Detail Pages) type pages, we would analyze the `EVENTS_20210102` table from the `GA4` database. By applying the refined page classification criteria to the URLs in each page view event, we can classify pages as either PDPs or PLPs (Product Listing Pages). The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of PDP page views by the total number of page views on that day and multiplying by 100.

Since the actual event data is not provided, we represent the percentage value as a float between 0 and 100 in the answer format. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Usage of ST_INTERSECTS: ST_INTERSECTS(geometry1, ST_GEOGFROMWKB(geometry2)) This function checks if the two geometries intersect. The first argument, geometry1, is compared with the second argument, geometry2, which is converted from its WKB (Well-Known Binary) representation to a geography type using ST_GEOGFROMWKB. If the two geometries share any portion of space, the function returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE. Usage of ST_CONTAINS: ST_CONTAINS(r1.geometry, r2.geometry) This function checks if the geometry r1.geometry completely contains the geometry r2.geometry. It returns TRUE if all points of r2.geometry are within r1.geometry and FALSE otherwise. This is useful for spatial containment queries, such as verifying whether one region is entirely within another. ARRAY_INTERSECTION(nodes1, nodes2): This function computes the intersection of the two arrays, returning a new array containing only the elements that are present in both nodes1 and nodes2. ARRAY_SIZE(...): This function then determines the size (or number of elements) in the resulting array from the intersection.

2025-01-19 11:45:25 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please find out what percentage of the page views on January 2, 2021, were for PDP type pages., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Percentage_of_PDP_page_views
percentage_value:float between 0 and 100
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine the percentage of page views on January 2, 2021, that were for PDP (Product Detail Pages) type pages, we would analyze the `EVENTS_20210102` table from the `GA4` database. By applying the refined page classification criteria to the URLs in each page view event, we can classify pages as either PDPs or PLPs (Product Listing Pages). The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of PDP page views by the total number of page views on that day and multiplying by 100.

Since the actual event data is not provided, we represent the percentage value as a float between 0 and 100 in the answer format. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
