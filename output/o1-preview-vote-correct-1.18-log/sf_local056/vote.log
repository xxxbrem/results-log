After carefully comparing the two SQL queries provided, I have chosen `0result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Date Parsing:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses `TRY_TO_DATE("payment_date")` to parse the `payment_date` field. This function attempts to convert the string to a date, returning `NULL` if it fails, which can prevent errors due to invalid date formats.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(P."payment_date")`, which converts the string to a timestamp without time zone. While both functions serve the purpose, `TRY_TO_DATE` is more appropriate when dealing with date values without time components or when the time component is irrelevant, as in this case.

2. **Consistency in Alias Usage:**
   - **`0result.sql`** consistently aliases tables and columns, which enhances readability and maintainability.
   - **`1result.sql`** mixes aliasing styles (e.g., sometimes using `P.` as a prefix and other times referencing columns directly), which can lead to confusion.

3. **Calculation of Monthly Changes:**
   - In **`0result.sql`**, the calculation of `monthly_change` is done once, and the absolute value is taken during the aggregation step. This approach is straightforward and aligns with standard practices for calculating average absolute changes.
   - In **`1result.sql`**, the absolute difference is calculated directly in the `monthly_changes` CTE. While this is also correct, applying the `ABS` function at this stage can slightly obscure the calculation of the actual change values before aggregation.

4. **Use of Standard Functions:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses standard SQL functions like `EXTRACT` and `LAG`, making it more portable and easier to understand for those familiar with SQL in general.
   - **`1result.sql`** includes functions specific to certain SQL dialects (e.g., `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ`), which might limit compatibility with other database systems.

5. **Simplicity and Clarity:**
   - **`0result.sql`** has a clearer structure with well-defined CTEs (`monthly_payments`, `monthly_changes`, `customer_avg_changes`, `highest_avg_change_customer`) that logically progress towards the final result.
   - The final `SELECT` statement in **`0result.sql`** is straightforward, joining the highest average change customer to retrieve the full name.

**Conclusion:**

Both queries ultimately produce the same correct resultâ€”identifying **STEPHEN QUALLS** as the customer with the highest average monthly change in payment amounts. However, due to its clarity, appropriate function usage, and consistency, `0result.sql` is the preferred choice.
