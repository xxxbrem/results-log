2025-01-19 07:23:47 - root - INFO - It appears there's a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks. In your `WHERE` clause, the string literal starts with a single quote but ends with a double quote. Let's correct the quotation marks so they match.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "from_address"
FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

Now, let's proceed to address your main task.

---

### **Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `TOKEN_TRANSFERS` in the `CRYPTO_ETHEREUM` schema.
- **Columns and Potential Usage:**
  - `"token_address"`: To filter transfers involving the specified token.
  - `"from_address"`: Addresses sending the token.
  - `"to_address"`: Addresses receiving the token.
  - `"value"`: Amount of tokens transferred (as a string, needs casting to numeric).
  - `"transaction_hash"`: Reference to specific transactions.

### **Conditions to Use:**

- **Filter by Specific Token Address:**
  - `"token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'`
- **Positive Token Transfer Values:**
  - `CAST("value" AS NUMERIC) > 0`

---

### **Calculating Balances to Find Top 3 Smallest Positive Balances:**

To find the Ethereum addresses with the top 3 smallest positive balances involving the specified token, we'll:

1. **Calculate the net balance** for each address involved with the token:
   - **Total Received**: Sum of `"value"` where the address is the `"to_address"`.
   - **Total Sent**: Sum of `"value"` where the address is the `"from_address"`.
   - **Net Balance**: Total Received - Total Sent.

2. **Filter for addresses with a positive net balance**.

3. **Order the results** by net balance in ascending order (smallest first).

4. **Select the top 3 addresses**.

---

### **SQL Query to Compute the Balances:**

```sql
SELECT
    addr AS "Address",
    SUM(received) - SUM(sent) AS "Balance"
FROM
    (
        -- Sum of tokens received by each address
        SELECT "to_address" AS addr, SUM(CAST("value" AS NUMERIC)) AS received, 0 AS sent
        FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
        WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
        GROUP BY "to_address"
        
        UNION ALL
        
        -- Sum of tokens sent by each address
        SELECT "from_address" AS addr, 0 AS received, SUM(CAST("value" AS NUMERIC)) AS sent
        FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
        WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
        GROUP BY "from_address"
    ) AS token_balances
GROUP BY addr
HAVING SUM(received) - SUM(sent) > 0
ORDER BY "Balance" ASC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Explanation of the Query:**

- **INNER SELECT Statements:**
  - The first `SELECT` calculates the total tokens received by each `"to_address"`.
  - The second `SELECT` calculates the total tokens sent by each `"from_address"`.
  - Both results are combined using `UNION ALL`.

- **OUTER SELECT Statement:**
  - Aggregates the received and sent amounts for each address (`addr`).
  - Calculates the net balance: `SUM(received) - SUM(sent)`.

- **HAVING Clause:**
  - Filters for addresses where the net balance is greater than zero (positive balance).

- **ORDER BY Clause:**
  - Orders the results by the net balance in ascending order to find the smallest positive balances.

- **LIMIT Clause:**
  - Limits the results to the top 3 addresses.

---

### **Final Answer:**

Assuming the query execution returns the results, the top 3 Ethereum addresses with the smallest positive balances are:

```csv
Address,Balance
address1:str,balance1:float > 0
address2:str,balance2:float > 0
address3:str,balance3:float > 0
(Attention: answer in this order)
```

**Note:** Replace `address1`, `balance1`, etc., with the actual addresses and balance values obtained from executing the SQL query.

---

### **Brief Explanation:**

- We analyzed the `TOKEN_TRANSFERS` table for the specified token address `'0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'`.

- Calculated the net balance for each address by summing the tokens they received and subtracting the tokens they sent.

- Filtered for addresses with a positive balance (i.e., they hold some amount of the token).

- Sorted the addresses by their balance in ascending order to find the ones with the smallest holdings.

- Selected the top 3 addresses with the smallest positive balances.

---

### **Additional SQL Queries for Verification and Exploration:**

1. **List All Addresses Involved with the Specified Token:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "from_address" AS addr
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
   
   UNION
   
   SELECT DISTINCT "to_address" AS addr
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab';
   ```

2. **Validate Token Transfer Values Format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "value"
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Check for Any Non-Numeric Values in 'value' Column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "value"
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE TRY_CAST("value" AS NUMERIC) IS NULL
     AND "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Total Number of Unique Addresses with Positive Balance:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM (
     SELECT addr
     FROM (
       SELECT "to_address" AS addr, SUM(CAST("value" AS NUMERIC)) AS received, 0 AS sent
       FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
       WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
       GROUP BY "to_address"

2025-01-19 07:24:15 - root - INFO - It appears there's a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.

Here's your original query:

```sql
SELECT "value"
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab"
   LIMIT 1000;
```

**Issue:**

- The string `'0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab"` starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
- This causes the SQL parser to expect a closing single quote but instead finds a double quote, leading to a syntax error.

**Correction:**

Ensure that the quotation marks enclosing the string literal match. Since you started with a single quote, you should also end with a single quote.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "value"
FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- Changed the ending double quote `"` to a single quote `'` in the `WHERE` clause.

**Now, the query should execute without syntax errors.**

---

If you run this corrected query, you should be able to retrieve the `"value"` column from the `TOKEN_TRANSFERS` table where the `"token_address"` matches `'0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'`.

2025-01-19 07:24:52 - root - INFO - It appears that there's a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the string literal for the `token_address` starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`, which causes the SQL parser to throw an error.

**Your Original Query:**

```sql
SELECT "value"
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab"
   LIMIT 1000;
```

**Issue:**

- **Mismatched Quotes**: The string starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
- **Resulting Error**: The SQL parser expects the string to end with a single quote, but finds a double quote instead, leading to a syntax error.

---

### **Correcting the SQL Query**

To fix the syntax error, ensure that the quotation marks around the string literal match. Since the string starts with a single quote `'`, it should also end with a single quote `'`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "value"
FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Changed the Ending Quote**: Replaced the ending double quote `"` with a single quote `'` to match the opening quote.
- **Consistent Quotation Marks**: Both the opening and closing quotation marks around the token address are now single quotes `'`.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Double-Check Quotation Marks**: Always ensure that your string literals start and end with the same type of quotation mark. In SQL, string literals are typically enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
- **Column and Table Names**: It's acceptable to enclose column and table names in double quotes `"..."` if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.

---

### **Verifying the Corrected Query**

You can now run the corrected query to retrieve the `"value"` column from the `TOKEN_TRANSFERS` table where the `"token_address"` matches the specified token:

```sql
SELECT "value"
FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
LIMIT 1000;
```

2025-01-19 07:25:13 - root - INFO - It seems you're encountering a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the string literal for `"token_address"` starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`, leading to a parsing error.

---

### **Your Original Query:**

```sql
SELECT "value"
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab"
   LIMIT 1000;
```

### **Issue Identified:**

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
- **Parsing Error:** SQL expects string literals to start and end with the same type of quotation mark. Mismatched quotes cause the parser to fail.

---

### **Correcting the Query:**

To fix the syntax error, ensure that the quotes around the string literal are consistent. Since you started with a single quote `'`, you should also end with a single quote `'`.

#### **Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT "value"
FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Matching Quotes:** Changed the ending double quote `"` to a single quote `'` to match the opening quote.
- **Consistent Quotation Marks:** Both the opening and closing quotation marks around the token address are now single quotes `'`.

---

### **Additional Guidance:**

- **String Literals in SQL:** String values should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
- **Identifiers in SQL:** Column names and table names can be enclosed in double quotes `"..."` if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.
- **Avoiding Future Errors:** Always double-check your queries for matching quotation marks to prevent syntax errors.

---

### **Running the Corrected Query:**

With the corrected query, you should now be able to retrieve the `"value"` column from the `TOKEN_TRANSFERS` table where the `"token_address"` matches `'0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'`.

**Corrected Query Ready to Run:**

```sql
SELECT "value"
FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **If You Continue to Experience Issues:**

- **Verify Quotation Marks:** Ensure all string literals use matching quotes.
- **Check for Hidden Characters:** Sometimes, copy-pasting can introduce hidden characters. Retype the quotes manually if necessary.
- **Consult the Error Message:** The error message points to the location of the parsing issue. In this case, it's near `<EOF>` (End Of File), indicating an unexpected end due to mismatched quotes.

   SELECT "value"
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Count Total Transfers Involving the Specified Token:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_transfers
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab';
   ```

7. **List Transactions with Zero Value Transfers for the Specified Token:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "transaction_hash", "value"
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
     AND CAST("value" AS NUMERIC) = 0
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Get Token Transfers Ordered by Block Timestamp Descending:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "block_timestamp", "from_address", "to_address", "value"
   FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
   WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'

Task: Which Ethereum address has the top 3 smallest positive balance from transactions involving the token at address "0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab"?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the Ethereum addresses with the top 3 smallest positive balances from transactions involving the token at address "0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab", we analyze the `TOKEN_TRANSFERS` table in the `CRYPTO_ETHEREUM` schema. We calculate the balance for each address by summing the incoming and outgoing token transfers associated with the specified token.

```csv
Address,Balance
address1:str,balance1:float > 0
address2:str,balance2:float > 0
address3:str,balance3:float > 0
(Attention: answer in this order)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CRYPTO': {'CRYPTO_BAND': ['BLOCKS', 'BLOCK_EVENTS', 'ERRORS', 'LOGS', 'MESSAGES', 'ORACLE_REQUESTS', 'TRANSACTIONS'], 'CRYPTO_BITCOIN': ['BLOCKS', 'INPUTS', 'OUTPUTS', 'TRANSACTIONS'], 'CRYPTO_BITCOIN_CASH': ['BLOCKS', 'INPUTS', 'OUTPUTS', 'TRANSACTIONS'], 'CRYPTO_DASH': ['BLOCKS', 'INPUTS', 'OUTPUTS', 'TRANSACTIONS'], 'CRYPTO_ETHEREUM': ['BLOCKS', 'CONTRACTS', 'LOGS', 'TOKEN_TRANSFERS', 'TRACES', 'TRANSACTIONS'], 'CRYPTO_ETHEREUM_CLASSIC': ['BALANCES', 'BLOCKS', 'CONTRACTS', 'LOGS', 'TOKENS', 'TOKEN_TRANSFERS', 'TRACES', 'TRANSACTIONS'], 'CRYPTO_ZILLIQA': ['DS_BLOCKS', 'EVENT_LOGS', 'EXCEPTIONS', 'TRANSACTIONS', 'TRANSITIONS', 'TX_BLOCKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive and negative signs.

2025-01-19 07:28:26 - root - INFO - To determine the Ethereum addresses with the top 3 smallest positive balances from transactions involving the token at address `0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab`, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "Address", "Balance"
FROM
(
    SELECT
        addr AS "Address",
        SUM(amount) AS "Balance"
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            "to_address" AS addr,
            TRY_TO_NUMBER("value") AS amount,
            "token_address"
        FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"

        UNION ALL

        SELECT
            "from_address" AS addr,
            -TRY_TO_NUMBER("value") AS amount,
            "token_address"
        FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM."TOKEN_TRANSFERS"
    ) AS token_flows
    WHERE "token_address" = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
    GROUP BY addr
) AS balances
WHERE "Balance" > 0
ORDER BY "Balance" ASC
LIMIT 3;
```

This query calculates the net balance of each address by summing the token amounts received and subtracting the amounts sent. It then filters for positive balances, orders them in ascending order, and limits the results to the top 3 addresses with the smallest positive balances.
