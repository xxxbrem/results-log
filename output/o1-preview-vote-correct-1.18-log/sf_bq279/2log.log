Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` (from database `AUSTIN`, schema `AUSTIN_BIKESHARE`)
   
   - **Column:** `"station_id"`: Used to identify distinct bike share stations.
   - **Column:** `"status"`: Indicates the status of a station (`Active` or `Closed`).
   - **Column:** `"modified_date"`: Represents the date when the station's status was last updated; used to extract the year (2013 or 2014).

**Conditions to Consider:**

- **Date Conditions:** Filter records where the `"modified_date"` falls within the years 2013 and 2014.
- **Status Conditions:** Check for stations with statuses of `Active` or `Closed`.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Retrieve Distinct Status Values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "status" 
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS;
   ```

2. **Check the Range of Modified Dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "modified_date" 
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
   ORDER BY "modified_date" ASC 
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Extract Year from Modified Date (Assuming UNIX Timestamp):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT YEAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) AS "year" 
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS;
   ```

4. **List Stations Modified in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "station_id" 
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
   WHERE YEAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) = 2013;
   ```

5. **List Stations Modified in 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "station_id" 
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
   WHERE YEAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) = 2014;
   ```

6. **Count Active Stations in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") 
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
   WHERE "status" ILIKE '%Active%' 
     AND YEAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) = 2013;
   ```

7. **Count Closed Stations in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") 
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
   WHERE "status" ILIKE '%Closed%' 
     AND YEAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) = 2013;
   ```

8. **Count Active Stations in 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") 
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
   WHERE "status" ILIKE '%Active%' 
     AND YEAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) = 2014;
   ```

9. **Count Closed Stations in 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") 
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
   WHERE "status" ILIKE '%Closed%' 
     AND YEAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) = 2014;
   ```

10. **Check Format of Modified Date Values:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "modified_date" 
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

**Additional Queries for Deeper Understanding:**

11. **List All Station IDs and Their Statuses:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "station_id", "status" 
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Find Stations with Null Modified Dates:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "station_id" 
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
    WHERE "modified_date" IS NULL;
    ```

13. **Verify If Modified Date Represents UNIX Timestamp:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "modified_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date") AS "timestamp" 
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **List Stations with Status Updated in 2013 or 2014:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "station_id", "status", YEAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) AS "year" 
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
    WHERE YEAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) IN (2013, 2014);
    ```

15. **Retrieve All Status Changes Over Time:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "station_id", "status", "modified_date" 
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS 
    ORDER BY "station_id", "modified_date";
    ```

**Notes:**

- **Date Conversion:** Since `"modified_date"` is of type `NUMBER(38,0)`, we assume it represents a UNIX timestamp. We use `TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")` to convert it to a timestamp format.
- **Case Sensitivity:** We use `ILIKE` for case-insensitive matching of the `"status"` values.
- **Limiting Results:** For queries that could return many rows, we use `LIMIT 1000` to preview the data.
- **Understanding Data Types:** Queries are designed to help us understand the format and range of values in the relevant columns without making assumptions beyond the given data.Query:

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we would analyze the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table from the `AUSTIN_BIKESHARE` schema. The `status` column indicates whether a station is active or closed, and the `modified_date` (representing the date when the status was last updated) would help us filter the records by year.

Here's the expected format of the results:

```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,Active,num1:int >=0
2013,Closed,num2:int >=0
2014,Active,num3:int >=0
2014,Closed,num4:int >=0
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: Indicates the year (2013 or 2014).
- **Status**: The status of the bike share stations (`Active` or `Closed`).
- **Number_of_Stations**: The count of distinct stations with the corresponding status in that year (a non-negative integer).

This table would provide a clear comparison of the number of active and closed stations for each year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATIONS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 04:45:43 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we would analyze the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table from the `AUSTIN_BIKESHARE` schema. The `status` column indicates whether a station is active or closed, and the `modified_date` (representing the date when the status was last updated) would help us filter the records by year.

Here's the expected format of the results:

```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,Active,num1:int >=0
2013,Closed,num2:int >=0
2014,Active,num3:int >=0
2014,Closed,num4:int >=0
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: Indicates the year (2013 or 2014).
- **Status**: The status of the bike share stations (`Active` or `Closed`).
- **Number_of_Stations**: The count of distinct stations with the corresponding status in that year (a non-negative integer).

This table would provide a clear comparison of the number of active and closed stations for each year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
