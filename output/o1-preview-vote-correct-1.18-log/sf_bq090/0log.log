The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': {'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': ['TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Firstly, consider the table and columns relevant to the task:

**Relevant Table:**
- `CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT`

**Relevant Columns:**
1. **"Sides"** (VARIANT): Potentially contains detailed trade information, including the strategy used (`feeling-lucky`, `momentum`) and the side of the trade (`long`, `short`).
2. **"LastPx"** (FLOAT): Represents the last price, possibly the market price at the time of the trade.
3. **"StrikePrice"** (FLOAT): The agreed-upon price in a derivative contract; used to calculate the intrinsic value.
4. **"Quantity"** (NUMBER): May be relevant for weighting averages if needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**
- Filtering trades where the strategy is either `feeling-lucky` or `momentum`.
- Selecting only long-side trades.
- Ensuring that the `LastPx` and `StrikePrice` are not null for accurate calculation of intrinsic value.

Now, to understand the data and confirm the availability of required information, here are 10 simple SQL queries:

1. **Inspect the "Sides" column to see its structure and contents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."Sides"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Flatten the "Sides" VARIANT column to explore its keys:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f.key
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Extract the "Strategy" from the "Sides" column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Strategy" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Extract the "Side" (long/short) from the "Sides" column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"Side"::STRING AS "Side"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Side" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Extract both "Strategy" and "Side" from the "Sides" column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy",
          f.value:"Side"::STRING AS "Side"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Strategy" IS NOT NULL AND f.value:"Side" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Identify all unique strategies used in trades:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Strategy" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List all trades with the "feeling-lucky" strategy:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t.*, f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Strategy"::STRING ILIKE '%feeling-lucky%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **List all trades with the "momentum" strategy:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t.*, f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Strategy"::STRING ILIKE '%momentum%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Calculate the intrinsic value for each trade (assuming Intrinsic Value = LastPx - StrikePrice):**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."TradeReportID",
          t."LastPx",
          t."StrikePrice",
          (t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice") AS "IntrinsicValue"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t
   WHERE t."LastPx" IS NOT NULL AND t."StrikePrice" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Extract strategy, side, and calculate intrinsic value for long-side trades:**

    ```sql
    SELECT f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy",
           f.value:"Side"::STRING AS "Side",
           (t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice") AS "IntrinsicValue"
    FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t,
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
    WHERE f.value:"Side"::STRING ILIKE '%long%'
      AND t."LastPx" IS NOT NULL
      AND t."StrikePrice" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries aim to:

- Understand the structure and contents of the `"Sides"` column, which is crucial for extracting the strategy and side information.
- Identify trades that use the specified strategies (`feeling-lucky`, `momentum`) and are on the long side.
- Calculate the intrinsic value for trades where necessary data (`"LastPx"` and `"StrikePrice"`) is available.

By executing these queries, we can determine whether the required data is present in the table and proceed to compute the average intrinsic values as per the task.Query:
SELECT t."Sides"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT t
   LIMIT 1000;

Task: How much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the provided table schema for the `TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT` table, we do not have the necessary data to compute the difference in average intrinsic value between trades using the feeling-lucky strategy and those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades. The table does not contain fields specifying the trade strategy or whether the trade is a long-side trade..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': {'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': ['TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the provided table schema for the `TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT` table, we do not have the necessary data to compute the difference in average intrinsic value between trades using the feeling-lucky strategy and those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades. The table does not contain fields specifying the trade strategy or whether the trade is a long-side trade. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
