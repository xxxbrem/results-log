After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL to answer the question. Here's the reasoning:

**Reasoning:**

1. **Strategy Identification:**
   - The crucial difference between the two SQL queries lies in how they identify the "feeling-lucky" strategy.
   - In **`0result.sql`**, the query maps strategies where `PartyID` starts with `'LUCKY%'` to `'FEELING_LUCKY'`.
   - In **`1result.sql`**, the query maps strategies where `PartyID` starts with `'PREDICT%'` to `'feeling-lucky'`.

2. **Correct Strategy Mapping:**
   - From the data provided, the `PartyID`s like `'PREDICTNQ'`, `'PREDICTES'`, and `'PREDICTBTC'` are associated with trades that should be categorized under the "feeling-lucky" strategy.
   - There is no evidence in the data of `PartyID`s starting with `'LUCKY%'`.
   - Therefore, mapping `'PREDICT%'` to `'feeling-lucky'` is the correct approach.

3. **Accurate Calculation:**
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly calculates the average intrinsic values for both strategies under long-side trades by:
     - Filtering trades where `Side = 'LONG'`.
     - Calculating the intrinsic value as `(LastPx - StrikePrice) * Quantity`.
     - Computing the averages for the "feeling-lucky" and "momentum" strategies based on the correct `PartyID` mapping.
   - The difference in averages is then computed by subtracting the average for "momentum" from the average for "feeling-lucky".

4. **Result Consistency:**
   - The result from **`1result.sql`** is `-0.027`, which indicates that the average intrinsic value for the "feeling-lucky" strategy is **lower** than that for the "momentum" strategy by `0.027`.
   - This aligns with the data, given the calculation method and the correct categorization of strategies.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since **`1result.sql`** correctly identifies the strategies based on the actual `PartyID`s in the data and accurately computes the required difference, it is the appropriate SQL query to answer the question.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
1result.sql
```
