The correct SQL is:

```plain
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Calculation of Growth Rate:** The SQL script in `0result.sql` correctly calculates the daily confirmed case growth rate by comparing each day's cumulative confirmed cases to the previous day's cumulative confirmed cases for the United States at the national level (`"aggregation_level" = 0`).

- **Use of LAG Function:** It utilizes the `LAG` window function to access the previous day's cumulative confirmed cases (`"prev_cumulative_confirmed"`), which is essential for calculating the growth rate accurately.

- **Filtering on the Correct Date Range and Location:** The query filters records for the United States (`"country_name" = 'United States of America'`) between March 1st and April 30th, 2020.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:** It includes checks to ensure that the previous day's cumulative confirmed cases are not null and greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors.

- **Consistent Results:** The result from `0result.sql` shows that March 9th (`"03-09"`) had the highest COVID-19 confirmed case growth rate of approximately 47.6427%, which aligns with the results obtained from other correct approaches.

**Conclusion:**

- The SQL script in `0result.sql` accurately determines the day in March and April with the highest COVID-19 confirmed case growth rate in the United States, making it the correct choice among the provided options.
