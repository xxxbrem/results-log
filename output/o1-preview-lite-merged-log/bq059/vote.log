After comparing the two SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice. Here's the reasoning:

- **Accurate Geographical Data**: The first query (`1result.sql`) joins the `bikeshare_trips` table with the `bikeshare_station_info` table to use the `station_geom` fields for both the start and end stations. This ensures that the most accurate and up-to-date geographical data is used for distance calculations.

- **Reliable Calculations**: Using `ST_DISTANCE` on the `station_geom` fields provides a more precise measurement than calculating distances from latitude and longitude columns in the trips table, as geometries account for the Earth's curvature and are less prone to errors.

- **Consistent Data Joining**: By joining on the station IDs and casting them appropriately, the query maintains data consistency and ensures that all necessary records are accurately matched.

- **Filtering Criteria**: The query correctly filters trips where the start or end station name contains 'Berkeley', focuses on trips with distances greater than 1000 meters, and only considers trips with a positive duration to avoid division by zero errors.

**Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct SQL query to determine the highest average speed for bike trips in Berkeley with a trip distance greater than 1000 meters.**
