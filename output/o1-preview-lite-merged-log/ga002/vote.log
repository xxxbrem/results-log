After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **2result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

Both SQL queries aim to identify the most purchased other products and their quantities by customers who bought the "Google Red Speckled Tee" for each month from November 2020 to January 2021. While both queries produce the same results, there are some differences:

1. **Date Handling:**
   - **2result.sql** uses the `EXTRACT` function combined with `PARSE_DATE` to accurately extract the month from the `event_date`, which is stored as a string. This method is more robust and handles date formats correctly.
   - **1result.sql** uses `SUBSTR` to extract the month portion from the `event_date` string. While this works, it is less reliable, especially if the date format changes.

2. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - **2result.sql** clearly separates the steps into Common Table Expressions (CTEs) named `customers`, `purchases`, and `ranked_purchases`, making the query easier to read and understand.
   - The use of `CASE` statements in **2result.sql** to order the months ensures that the months are presented chronologically.

3. **SQL Standards Compliance:**
   - Using date functions like `EXTRACT` and `PARSE_DATE` adheres to SQL standards and best practices, improving compatibility and maintenance.

**Conclusion:**

Given the better date handling, clarity, and adherence to SQL best practices, **2result.sql** is the correct and preferred SQL query.
