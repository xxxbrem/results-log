After comparing the SQL queries provided, I have determined that `0result.sql` is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Correct Time Period Conditions**: 
   - **Inclusion of Payments from Initial Purchase Date**: In `0result.sql`, the conditions for calculating sales in the first 7 and 30 days are accurately specified using:
     - `p."payment_date" >= fp."initial_purchase_date"`
     - `p."payment_date" < datetime(fp."initial_purchase_date", '+7 days')` (or '+30 days')
   - This ensures that only payments made **on or after** the initial purchase date and **before** the exact 7 or 30-day threshold are included. This adheres to the requirement of using exact hours, minutes, and seconds, not just calendar days.
   - **Exclusion of Payments Before Initial Purchase**: The query correctly excludes any payments that might occur before the initial purchase date.

2. **Excludes Customers with Zero Lifetime Sales**:
   - `0result.sql` explicitly filters out customers with zero lifetime sales in the `customer_totals` CTE using the `HAVING SUM(p."amount") > 0` clause, as required.

3. **Modular and Readable Structure Using CTEs**:
   - The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in `0result.sql` breaks down the problem into logical steps:
     - `first_purchase`: Calculates initial purchase dates.
     - `customer_totals`: Computes total lifetime sales per customer, excluding those with zero sales.
     - `customer_sales`: Calculates sales in the first 7 and 30 days.
     - `customer_percentages`: Computes the percentages of sales in the first 7 and 30 days relative to total lifetime sales.
   - This modular approach enhances readability and maintainability, making it easier to verify the correctness of each step.

4. **Accurate Percentage Calculations**:
   - The percentages are calculated by dividing the sales in the first 7 or 30 days by the total lifetime sales for each customer, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.
   - The final averages are rounded to four decimal places and formatted with a '%' sign, as specified.

5. **Consistent Results Across Queries**:
   - While all three queries produce the same numerical results, `0result.sql` ensures correctness through precise conditions and thorough filtering, aligning fully with the task requirements.

**Conclusion**:

Given the above reasons, `0result.sql` is the SQL query that best meets the specified requirements, correctly calculates the average percentages of total lifetime sales occurring in the first 7 and 30 days after a customer's initial purchase, and includes the average total lifetime sales (LTV).
