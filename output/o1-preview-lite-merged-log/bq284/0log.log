2025-01-23 10:29:54 - root - INFO - It looks like you're encountering an error because the SQL query cannot begin with a `WHERE` clause. In SQL, the `WHERE` clause is used to filter records and must be placed after the `FROM` clause in a `SELECT` statement.

**Error Explanation:**

- **Error Message:**

  ```
  400 Syntax error: Unexpected keyword WHERE at [1:1];
  reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unexpected keyword WHERE at [1:1]
  ```

- **Cause:** 

  The query begins with `WHERE`, which is not valid SQL syntax. The `WHERE` clause cannot stand alone; it needs to be part of a larger `SELECT` statement.

---

**Solution:**

You need to include a `SELECT` statement with a `FROM` clause before the `WHERE` clause. Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
WHERE LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%'
LIMIT 100
```

---

**Addressing the Original Task:**

To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  `category`,
  COUNT(*) AS total_articles,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(
    COUNTIF(LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%'),
    COUNT(*)
  ) * 100 AS percentage_mentioning_education
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
GROUP BY
  `category`
ORDER BY
  total_articles DESC
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation:**

- **`SELECT` Clause:**

  - `category`: Retrieves the category of the articles.
  - `COUNT(*) AS total_articles`: Counts the total number of articles in each category.
  - `COUNTIF(LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%')`: Counts the number of articles mentioning "education" in the `body` column.
  - `SAFE_DIVIDE(...) * 100`: Calculates the percentage of articles mentioning "education" in each category. `SAFE_DIVIDE` is used to avoid division by zero errors.

- **`FROM` Clause:**

  - Specifies the table to query: `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`.

- **`GROUP BY` Clause:**

  - Groups the results by `category` to aggregate the counts.

- **`ORDER BY` Clause:**

  - Orders the results by `total_articles` in descending order to show categories with the most articles first.

- **`LIMIT` Clause:**

  - Limits the result set to 100 rows.

---

**Final Output Format:**

Based on the query above, the data can be presented as:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_Mentioning_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Where:**

- **Category**: The category name (e.g., "Business", "Sport").
- **Total_Articles**: Total number of articles in that category.
- **Percentage_Mentioning_Education**: The percentage of articles mentioning "education" within that category.

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Ensure Correct Syntax:** Always start your SQL queries with a `SELECT` clause.
- **Case Sensitivity:** Using `LOWER()` ensures the search for "education" is case-insensitive.
- **Avoiding Division by Zero:** If a category has zero articles, `SAFE_DIVIDE` prevents errors by returning `NULL` instead of raising an error.

---

**Example SQL Queries for Understanding Data:**

Here are revised SQL queries that you can run to explore the data further:

1. **Retrieve All Distinct Categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `category`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

2. **Count Total Number of Articles in Each Category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `category`, COUNT(*) AS total_articles
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   GROUP BY `category`
   ORDER BY total_articles DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

3. **List Articles Mentioning "Education" Along with Their Categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `category`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   WHERE LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

4. **Count Number of Articles Mentioning "Education" in Each Category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `category`, COUNT(*) AS education_articles
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   WHERE LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%'
   GROUP BY `category`
   ORDER BY education_articles DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

5. **Calculate Percentage of Articles Mentioning "Education" in Each Category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     `category`,
     COUNT(*) AS total_articles,
     COUNTIF(LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%') AS education_articles,
     SAFE_DIVIDE(
       COUNTIF(LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%'),
       COUNT(*)
     ) * 100 AS percentage_mentioning_education
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   GROUP BY
     `category`
   ORDER BY
     percentage_mentioning_education DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

---

**Remember:**

- Replace any placeholder fields with actual values if necessary.
- Ensure you're using the correct project and dataset IDs.
- Check for any typos or syntax errors before executing the queries.

"By 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.

Around 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT. It compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.

The study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.

The gap between ""have-nets"" and ""have-nots"" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. ""Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,"" said Mr Hosford.

As now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.

Those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. ""If we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.

2025-01-23 10:31:04 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-23 10:31:04 - root - INFO - It looks like you're encountering an error because your SQL query starts with a `WHERE` clause, which is not valid SQL syntax. In SQL, a query must begin with a `SELECT` statement, and the `WHERE` clause is used to filter results after specifying the columns and table.

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unexpected keyword WHERE at [1:1]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unexpected keyword WHERE at [1:1]
```

**Cause of the Error:**

- The query starts with `WHERE`, but it needs to start with a `SELECT` statement.

**Solution:**

Include a `SELECT` statement and specify the table using `FROM` before the `WHERE` clause. Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%education%'
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation:**

- **`SELECT *`**: Selects all columns from the table.
- **`FROM`**: Specifies the table to query (`bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`).
- **`WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%education%'`**: Filters records where the `title` column contains the word "education" (case-insensitive).
- **`LIMIT 100`**: Limits the result to 100 rows.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Case-Insensitive Search:** Using `LOWER()` on the `title` column and the search string ensures that the search is not case-sensitive.
- **Wildcard `%` Usage:** The `%` symbols before and after `education` allow for any characters to appear before or after the word "education" in the title.

**Example Usage:**

If you run the corrected query, you should retrieve up to 100 articles from the BBC News dataset where the title mentions "education".

Too long, hard cut:

"By 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.

Around 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT. It compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.

The study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.

The gap between ""have-nets"" and ""have-nots"" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. ""Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,"" said Mr Hosford.

As now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.

Those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. ""If we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.
",Millions to miss out on the net,bbc/tech/226.txt,tech
"By 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.

Around 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT. It compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.

The study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.

The gap between ""have-nets"" and ""have-nots"" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. ""Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psyc

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News, the data can be structured as follows:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_Mentioning_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Category**: The category of the BBC News articles (e.g., "Business", "Sports").
- **Total_Articles**: The total number of articles in each category.
- **Percentage_Mentioning_Education**: The percentage of articles within each category that mention "education". This value is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Articles Mentioning "Education"}}{\text{Total Articles}} \right) \times 100
  \].
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'bbc_news': ['fulltext']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 10:38:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News, the data can be structured as follows:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_Mentioning_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Category**: The category of the BBC News articles (e.g., "Business", "Sports").
- **Total_Articles**: The total number of articles in each category.
- **Percentage_Mentioning_Education**: The percentage of articles within each category that mention "education". This value is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Articles Mentioning "Education"}}{\text{Total Articles}} \right) \times 100
  \] The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
