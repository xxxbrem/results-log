After comparing both SQL queries and their results, we can make the following observations:

**1. Differences in the WHERE Clause:**

- **First SQL (`1result.sql`):**

  ```sql
  WHERE id.`indicator_code` = 'NY.GDP.MKTP.KD'
    AND id.`year` = 2019
    AND cs.`region` != ''
  ```

  - Excludes regions where `cs.region` is an empty string (`''`).

- **Second SQL (`2result.sql`):**

  ```sql
  WHERE i.indicator_code = 'NY.GDP.MKTP.KD'
    AND i.year = 2019
    AND cs.region IS NOT NULL
  ```

  - Excludes regions where `cs.region` is `NULL`.

**2. Impact on Results:**

- In the dataset, there are entries where `cs.region` is an empty string (`''`). These typically represent aggregate groups or non-country entities (e.g., "World", "High income", "Low & middle income").
- These aggregate entries often have significantly higher GDP values, which can skew the median calculation if included.
- By excluding entries with an empty string for the region, we ensure that only valid, named regions consisting of actual countries are considered in the analysis.

**3. Conclusion:**

- **The first SQL query (`1result.sql`) is more appropriate** because it filters out both `NULL` and empty string regions, focusing the analysis on meaningful regions.
- This leads to a more accurate determination of which region has the highest median GDP among the valid regions.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plaintext
1result.sql
