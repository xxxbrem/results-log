0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

I choose **`0result.sql`** as the correct SQL script because it effectively accomplishes the task requirements while adhering closely to the constraints provided. Here's why:

1. **Adherence to Constraints:**
   - **No Recursive CTEs:** Unlike the other scripts, `0result.sql` does not use recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs), which may not be supported in all SQLite environments or might be beyond basic SQL features acceptable under the constraints.
   - **Standard SQL Functions:** It utilizes standard SQL functions such as `SUBSTR`, `GROUP_CONCAT`, and basic subqueries, which are widely supported and do not require advanced SQL capabilities or custom functions.

2. **Correctness and Efficiency:**
   - **Extracting Letters:** The script extracts up to five letters (`l1` to `l5`) for each word using `SUBSTR`, accommodating words of length 4 to 5.
   - **Sorting Letters:** It constructs a "signature" for each word by sorting its letters alphabetically within a subquery. This allows for accurate grouping of words that are anagrams of each other.
   - **Counting Anagrams:** It groups the words by their sorted signatures and counts the number of occurrences, identifying words that have at least one anagram (where the count is greater than 1).
   - **Final Output:** The script selects the words along with their anagram counts, orders them alphabetically, and limits the result to the first 10 words as required.

3. **Simplicity and Readability:**
   - **Clear Structure:** The script is structured in a way that is easy to follow, with appropriately named CTEs that outline each step of the process.
   - **Maintainability:** By avoiding recursive queries and complex SQL constructs, the script remains maintainable and understandable for future users or developers reviewing the code.

4. **Consistent Results:**
   - The output produced by `0result.sql` matches the expected results, listing the first 10 words (of length 4 to 5, starting with 'r') that have at least one anagram, along with their anagram counts.

**Conclusion:**

By effectively balancing the task requirements with adherence to the provided constraints, `0result.sql` stands out as the most appropriate and correct SQL script among the options provided.
