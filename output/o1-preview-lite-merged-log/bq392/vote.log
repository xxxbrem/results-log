1result.sql

I chose `1result.sql` as the correct answer because it correctly addresses the task by:

- **Calculating the average temperature per date**: It groups the data by date and computes the average temperature using `AVG(temp)`.
- **Properly constructing the date**: It uses the `DATE` function with `CAST` to convert year, month, and day into integers, ensuring accurate date representation.
- **Formatting the date correctly**: It formats the date as `YYYY-MM-DD` using `FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', ...)`, which matches the required output format.
- **Filtering out invalid temperature values**: It excludes records where `temp = 9999.9`, which indicates missing data.
- **Limiting the results to the top 3 dates**: It orders the results by average temperature in descending order and limits the output to the top 3 dates.

Compared to the other SQL queries:

- **`0result.sql`**: While it also calculates the average temperature per date and formats the date, it uses string concatenation and `PARSE_DATE` to construct the date. This method is less precise because it relies on string manipulation, which can introduce errors if the date components are not correctly padded or if there are invalid values.
- **`2result.sql`**: This query does not calculate the average temperature per date. Instead, it selects individual temperature records and orders them by temperature. This means it could return multiple entries for the same date if there are multiple records, and it doesn't provide the average temperature per date, which the task requires.

By choosing `1result.sql`, we ensure that the query accurately fulfills all the requirements of the task, providing the correct top 3 dates in October 2009 with the highest average temperatures for station number 723758.
