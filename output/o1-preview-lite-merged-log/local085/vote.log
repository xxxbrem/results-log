After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct query for accurately determining the top 3 employees with the highest percentage of late orders, considering only those with more than 50 total orders.

**Here's the analysis:**

### **Query 0 (`0result.sql`):**

```sql
SELECT
    "employeeid" AS "EmployeeID",
    SUM(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" > "requireddate" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Number_of_Late_Orders",
    ROUND((CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" > "requireddate" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / COUNT("orderid")) * 100, 4) AS "Percentage_of_Late_Orders"
FROM
    "orders"
GROUP BY
    "employeeid"
HAVING
    COUNT("orderid") > 50
ORDER BY
    "Percentage_of_Late_Orders" DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

- **Issue:** This query does not account for orders where `"shippeddate"` or `"requireddate"` is `NULL`. Including such orders in the total count (`COUNT("orderid")`) may skew the percentage calculation, as orders without these dates cannot be classified as late or on time.
- **Result:** The percentage of late orders might be underestimated because the denominator includes orders with missing dates.

### **Query 1 (`1result.sql`):**

```sql
SELECT "employeeid" AS "EmployeeID",
       SUM(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" > "requireddate" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Number_of_Late_Orders",
       ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" > "requireddate" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 4) AS "Percentage_of_Late_Orders"
FROM "orders"
GROUP BY "employeeid"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50
ORDER BY "Percentage_of_Late_Orders" DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

- **Issue:** Similar to Query 0, this query does not filter out orders with `NULL` `"shippeddate"` or `"requireddate"`. Using `COUNT(*)` includes all orders, even those lacking necessary date information for determining lateness.
- **Result:** The percentage calculation may be inaccurate due to inclusion of orders with incomplete data.

### **Query 2 (`2result.sql`):**

```sql
SELECT "employeeid" AS "EmployeeID",
       COUNT(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" > "requireddate" THEN 1 END) AS "Number_of_Late_Orders",
       ROUND(
           COUNT(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" > "requireddate" THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 4
       ) AS "Percentage_of_Late_Orders"
FROM "orders"
WHERE "shippeddate" IS NOT NULL
  AND "requireddate" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "employeeid"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50
ORDER BY "Percentage_of_Late_Orders" DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

- **Correct Approach:** This query **correctly filters out** orders where either `"shippeddate"` or `"requireddate"` is `NULL` by using the `WHERE` clause:
  ```sql
  WHERE "shippeddate" IS NOT NULL
    AND "requireddate" IS NOT NULL
  ```
- **Accurate Denominator:** The denominator in the percentage calculation (`COUNT(*)`) now accurately reflects the total number of orders that have both dates present, ensuring only relevant orders are considered.
- **Result:** The calculated percentages are accurate, representing the true proportion of late deliveries among orders that can be evaluated.

**Differences in Results:**

- Queries 0 and 1 show lower percentages compared to Query 2. This is because they include orders with missing dates in their total counts, reducing the calculated percentage of late orders.
- Query 2 shows slightly higher percentages, correctly indicating the proportion of late orders among orders with complete date information.

**Conclusion:**

For accurate calculation of late order percentages:

- Only orders with non-`NULL` `"shippeddate"` and `"requireddate"` should be considered.
- The total number of orders (`COUNT(*)`) should reflect only those orders eligible for lateness evaluation.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query.
