After carefully comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

### **Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Calculation:** All three SQL queries aim to calculate the median of the highest season goals scored by each team, and they all produce the same result of **48.0**. This indicates that they are functionally correct.

- **Clarity and Readability:**

  - **`1result.sql`** uses clear and descriptive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `team_season_goals`, `team_highest_goals`, `ordered_highest_goals`, and `median_values`. This makes the query easier to understand and maintain.

  - It utilizes window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` and `COUNT(*) OVER ()`, which are standard SQL features for such computations. This approach is efficient and adheres to good SQL practices.

- **Efficient Median Calculation:**

  - The query correctly handles both odd and even numbers of teams when calculating the median by selecting the appropriate middle value(s) and then computing the average if necessary.

  - By using `(team_count + 1) / 2` and `(team_count + 2) / 2`, it effectively finds the median positions without complex conditional logic.
