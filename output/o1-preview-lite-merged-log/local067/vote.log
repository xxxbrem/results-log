After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that `1result.sql` is the correct query for the following reasons:

1. **Join Conditions with the `costs` Table:**

   - In `1result.sql`, the `sales` table is joined with the `costs` table on `prod_id` and `time_id`:

     ```sql
     JOIN "costs" AS co ON s."prod_id" = co."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = co."time_id"
     ```

   - This is consistent with our earlier analysis and queries, where we identified that the `costs` table can be joined to `sales` based on `prod_id` and `time_id` to get the correct `unit_cost` for each sale.

   - In `2result.sql`, additional join conditions are included for `promo_id` and `channel_id`:

     ```sql
     JOIN "costs" cst ON s."prod_id" = cst."prod_id"
                      AND s."time_id" = cst."time_id"
                      AND s."promo_id" = cst."promo_id"
                      AND s."channel_id" = cst."channel_id"
     ```

   - This may be too restrictive and could lead to missing some cost data, as not all combinations of `promo_id` and `channel_id` might be present in the `costs` table. This can result in incomplete or incorrect profit calculations.

2. **Profit Calculations:**

   - The total profits calculated in `1result.sql` are higher and more consistent with the earlier profit figures we observed in previous queries.

     - For example, the highest profit in `1result.sql` is approximately 2,790.37, which aligns with the total profits we calculated earlier for Italian customers in December 2021.

   - In `2result.sql`, the profits are significantly lower, with the highest profit being 785.15. This suggests that some sales data might be missing due to the additional join conditions.

3. **Consistency with Earlier Analysis:**

   - The approach in `1result.sql` aligns with the step-by-step queries and calculations we performed earlier, ensuring that we include all relevant sales data for Italian customers in December 2021.

   - The tier segmentation logic in `1result.sql` uses a manual calculation based on the total number of customers, which accurately divides the customers into ten evenly divided tiers.

4. **Use of NTILE Function:**

   - While `NTILE(10)` in `2result.sql` is a valid method to segment data into ten groups, the discrepancies in profit calculations due to the join conditions make the results less reliable.

Based on these reasons, I conclude that `1result.sql` is the correct SQL query.
