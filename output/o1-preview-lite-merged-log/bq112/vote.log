After comparing the two SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Annual Wage Calculation:** `1result.sql` multiplies the average weekly wages by 52 to convert them into annual wages before calculating the growth rate. This is important because we are comparing the increase in **annual wages** to the inflation rate over the years.

  ```sql
  ROUND(((w2017.avg_weekly_wage * 52 - w1998.avg_weekly_wage * 52) / (w1998.avg_weekly_wage * 52) * 100), 4) AS Wage_growth_rate
  ```

- **Consistency with Inflation Data:** Since inflation rates are calculated based on annual figures, comparing them with annual wage growth provides an accurate assessment of whether wages kept pace with inflation.

- **Use of `area_fips`:** Both queries correctly identify Allegheny County using the appropriate geographic identifier (`area_fips = '42003'`), ensuring the data pertains to the correct region.

- **CPI Data Accuracy:** Both queries use the national average CPI (`area_code = '0000'` and `item_code = 'SA0'`), which is appropriate for comparing general inflation rates.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**

```plaintext
1result.sql
