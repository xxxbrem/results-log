Between the two SQL queries provided (`0result.sql` and `2result.sql`), the correct SQL that fulfills the task is **`2result.sql`**.

**Reasoning:**

- **`0result.sql`**:
  - This query directly uses the `sid` `'2020233N14313'` to retrieve information about Hurricane **Laura**.
  - While Hurricane Laura indeed has the third longest total travel distance in the North Atlantic during 2020, this query **hardcodes** the `sid`.
  - Hardcoding the `sid` means that if the data changes (e.g., new data is added, or the travel distances are recalculated), the query might no longer retrieve the correct hurricane.

- **`2result.sql`**:
  - This query **dynamically** calculates the total travel distances for all hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin during 2020.
  - It then selects the hurricane with the third longest total travel distance using `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2`.
  - By computing the `sid` based on the data, the query ensures that it always retrieves the correct hurricane, even if the underlying data changes.
  - This approach makes the query **robust**, **accurate**, and **maintainable**.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query because it satisfies the requirement to display information about the hurricane with the third longest travel distance **without hardcoding any specific `sid`**.
