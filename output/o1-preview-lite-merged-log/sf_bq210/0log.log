2025-01-20 05:41:26 - root - INFO - It appears that there's a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the value for `"country_code"` is not properly enclosed within single quotes.

**Your Query:**

```sql
SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US" AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Issue:**

- The value `'US"` has an opening single quote `'` but closes with a double quote `"`. This leads to a syntax error because the SQL parser cannot find the matching closing single quote.

**Correction:**

- Ensure that the value `'US'` is properly enclosed within single quotes.
- Remove the extraneous double quote after `US`.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **"country_code" = 'US'**: Properly encloses the country code value within single quotes.
- **"kind_code" = 'B2'**: Ensures you're selecting patents with kind code 'B2'.
- **"grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231**: Filters patents granted between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018.

Please try running the corrected query above. This should resolve the syntax error and return the desired results.

2025-01-20 05:42:01 - root - INFO - It seems there is a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in the `WHERE` clause. Let's examine your query and identify the issues.

---

**Your Query:**

```sql
SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US" AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Mismatched Quotation Marks for `'US'`**:

   - You have `"country_code" = 'US"` with an opening single quote `'` and a closing double quote `"`:
     ```sql
     "country_code" = 'US"
     ```
   - This causes the SQL parser to expect the string to be closed with a single quote but encounters a double quote instead, leading to a syntax error.

2. **Impact on Parsing `'B2'`**:

   - Because the opening string is not properly closed, the parser cannot correctly interpret subsequent parts of the query, including:
     ```sql
     "kind_code" = 'B2'
     ```
   - The parser misinterprets `'B2'` because it's still looking to close the previously opened string.

---

**Corrected Query:**

Ensure all string literals are properly enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`. Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Fixed Quotation Marks for `'US'`**:

   - Changed from:
     ```sql
     "country_code" = 'US"
     ```
   - To:
     ```sql
     "country_code" = 'US'
     ```
   - Now, the string `'US'` is properly enclosed within single quotes.

2. **No Change Needed for `'B2'`**:

   - The condition:
     ```sql
     "kind_code" = 'B2'
     ```
   - Is already correctly formatted with matching single quotes.

---

**Next Steps:**

- Run the corrected query in your SQL environment.
- This should resolve the syntax error, and you should receive the expected results without any compilation errors.

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Quotation Marks in SQL**:

  - **Single Quotes `'...'`**: Used for string literals (e.g., `'US'`, `'B2'`).
  - **Double Quotes `"..."`**: Used for identifiers like column names or table names when they contain special characters or are case-sensitive.

- **Consistent Quoting**:

  - Always ensure that the opening and closing quotation marks match.
  - Mixing single and double quotes can lead to syntax errors.

- **Common Practice**:

  - For standard SQL queries, it's conventional to use single quotes for string values and double quotes for delimited identifiers.

---

By correcting the mismatched quotation marks, your query should execute successfully. If you encounter any further errors or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

2025-01-20 05:42:25 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering the same SQL compilation error due to mismatched quotation marks in your query. Let's carefully examine your query and identify the issue.

---

**Your Query:**

```sql
SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US" AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
   LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Issue Identified:**

- **Mismatched Quotation Marks in `"country_code"` Condition:**

  - The condition in your `WHERE` clause is written as:

    ```sql
    "country_code" = 'US"
    ```

  - Here, the string `'US"` starts with a single quote `'` and ends with a double quote `"`. This mismatch leads to a syntax error because SQL expects the opening and closing quotes to be the same type.

- **Impact on Parsing the Query:**

  - Due to the mismatched quotes, the SQL parser cannot properly interpret the rest of the query. It continues to look for the closing single quote `'` for the `'US"` string, and when it encounters `'B2'`, it raises an error near `'B2'`.

---

**Solution:**

- **Correct the Quotation Marks:**

  - Ensure that all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.
  - The corrected condition should be:

    ```sql
    "country_code" = 'US'
    ```

- **Full Corrected Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
  FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
  WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

---

**Explanation:**

- **"country_code" = 'US'**: Properly encloses `'US'` with single quotes.

- **"kind_code" = 'B2'**: This condition is already correctly formatted.

- **"grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231**: Filters patents granted from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018.

- **LIMIT 1000**: Limits the results to the first 1,000 records.

---

**Action Steps:**

1. **Copy the Corrected Query:**

   - Please copy the entire corrected query provided above.

2. **Run the Query:**

   - Paste it into your SQL client or environment.

3. **Verify the Results:**

   - The query should now run without syntax errors and return the desired results.

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistent Quoting:**

  - Always use single quotes `'` for string literals in SQL.
  - Double quotes `"` are typically used for identifiers (e.g., column names, table names), especially when they contain special characters or are case-sensitive.

- **Avoid Copy-Paste Errors:**

  - When copying queries, ensure that quotation marks are not altered or replaced by formatting.

---

**Example Execution:**

Assuming your database connection and permissions are correctly set up, running the corrected query should yield results similar to:

```csv
publication_number,grant_date
US-8000001-B2,20110816
US-8000002-B2,20110816
US-8000003-B2,20110816
...
```

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS`

  - **"country_code"**: To filter for US patents (e.g., `"country_code" = 'US'`).
  - **"kind_code"**: To identify patents with kind code 'B2' (e.g., `"kind_code" = 'B2'`).
  - **"grant_date"**: To filter patents granted between 2008 and 2018 (e.g., `"grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231`).
  - **"claims_localized"**: Contains the claims text; used to check if claims include the word 'claim'.
  - **"claims_localized_html"**: HTML-formatted claims; could be used similarly to "claims_localized".
  - **"publication_number"**: Unique identifier for publications; useful for selecting specific records.
  - **"title_localized"**: Contains the title of the patent; may provide additional context.
  - **"abstract_localized"**: Contains the abstract of the patent; useful for understanding patent content.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- Filter patents where `"country_code" = 'US'`.
- Select patents with `"kind_code" = 'B2'`.
- Filter by grant date using `"grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231"`.
- Check claims that do not include the word 'claim' using string matching (e.g., `NOT ILIKE '%claim%'`).

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct country codes to understand available countries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Find distinct kind codes for US patents to identify types:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "kind_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Select publication numbers and kind codes for US patents:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "kind_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Retrieve grant dates for US B2 patents to see date distribution:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Filter US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US" AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **View claims in localized format for US B2 patents:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "claims_localized"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Extract individual claim texts using LATERAL FLATTEN:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", f.value::VARIANT:"text"::STRING AS "claim_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US' AND t."kind_code" = 'B2'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Find claims that do not include the word 'claim' in the text:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", f.value::VARIANT:"text"::STRING AS "claim_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US' AND t."kind_code" = 'B2' AND f.value::VARIANT:"text"::STRING NOT ILIKE '%claim%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve titles of US patents for context:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "title_localized"::STRING AS "title_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **View abstracts of US patents to understand patent summaries:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "publication_number", "abstract_localized"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US'
    LIMIT 1000;

Task: How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims not including the word 'claim', the result is presented in the following format:

```csv
number_of_patents
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
