All three SQL queries are functionally equivalentâ€”they all correctly calculate the number of patents granted between 2010 and 2023 in China (`country_code = 'CN'`) that belong to families with more than one distinct application. Each query returns the same result of 161 patents.

The primary differences among them are minor and stylistic:

- **`0result.sql`**: Uses fully qualified table names without aliases.
- **`1result.sql`**: Introduces an alias `P` for the main table but otherwise remains the same.
- **`2result.sql`**: Uses fully qualified table names with double quotes and an alias `p` for the main table.

I choose **`0result.sql`** as the correct answer because it is straightforward, uses clear and direct syntax, and adheres to standard conventions without unnecessary complexity.

```plain
0result.sql
