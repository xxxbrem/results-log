**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **shopping_cart_events**
   - **"visit_id"**: Identifies a unique session or visit.
   - **"cookie_id"**: Identifies the user.
   - **"page_id"**: Used to identify the page viewed; can be mapped to products via the "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" table.
   - **"event_type"**: Numerical code representing the type of event; can be mapped to event names using the "shopping_cart_event_identifier" table.
   - **"sequence_number"**: The order of events within a session.
   - **"event_time"**: Timestamp of the event.

2. **shopping_cart_page_hierarchy**
   - **"page_id"**: Used to join with "shopping_cart_events" to associate events with products.
   - **"product_id"**: Unique identifier for each product.
   - **"page_name"**: Name of the page; may include product information.
   - **"product_category"**: Category of the product.

3. **shopping_cart_event_identifier**
   - **"event_type"**: Used to join with "shopping_cart_events" to get the event name.
   - **"event_name"**: Descriptive name of the event (e.g., 'View', 'Add to Cart', 'Purchase').

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Exclude records where **"page_id"** is in (1, 2, 12, 13).
- Map **"event_type"** to **"event_name"** to identify specific user actions.
- Aggregate events by **"product_id"** to calculate counts for views, adds to cart, products left in cart, and purchases.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct event types and their corresponding names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "event_type", "event_name"
   FROM "shopping_cart_event_identifier"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get distinct page IDs and their associated product IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "page_id", "product_id"
   FROM "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all distinct product IDs excluding specific page IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT ph."product_id"
   FROM "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" AS ph
   WHERE ph."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve the number of times each event type occurred:**

   ```sql
   SELECT e."event_type", COUNT(*) AS "event_count"
   FROM "shopping_cart_events" AS e
   GROUP BY e."event_type"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count the number of views per product:**

   GROUP BY ph."product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count the number of times each product was added to the cart:**

    ORDER BY e."visit_id", e."sequence_number"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data and the relationships between the tables. By executing them, we can gather the necessary information to calculate:

- **Views**: The number of times each product was viewed.
- **Adds to Cart**: The number of times each product was added to the shopping cart.
- **Left in Cart**: The number of times each product was added to the cart but not purchased.
- **Actual Purchases**: The number of times each product was purchased.

**Note:** All queries exclude products with **"page_id"** in (1, 2, 12, 13) as per the requirement.Query:

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of how many times each product was viewed, how many times they were added to the shopping cart, and how many times they were left in the cart without being purchased? Also, give me the count of actual purchases for each product. Ensure that products with a page id in (1, 2, 12, 13) are filtered out.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Views,Adds_to_Cart,Left_in_Cart,Actual_Purchases
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,views1:int,adds_to_cart1:int,left_in_cart1:int,actual_purchases1:int
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,views2:int,adds_to_cart2:int,left_in_cart2:int,actual_purchases2:int
...
```

This table provides a breakdown for each product (excluding those with page_id in (1, 2, 12, 13)). It shows the number of times each product was viewed, how many times they were added to the shopping cart, how many times they were left in the cart without being purchased, and the count of actual purchases for each product..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Also, give me the count of actual purchases for each product. Ensure that products with a page id in (1, 2, 12, 13) are filtered out., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
