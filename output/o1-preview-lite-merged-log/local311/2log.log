Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task **"Which constructors had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and in which years did they achieve them?"**, we need to consider the following tables and columns:

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

1. **Constructors Table (`constructors`):**
   - `"constructor_id"`: Used to uniquely identify each constructor.
   - `"name"`: The name of the constructor.
   - **Usage:** To get the names of the constructors.

2. **Constructor Standings Table (`constructor_standings`):**
   - `"constructor_id"`: Links to the constructors table.
   - `"race_id"`: To associate standings with specific races.
   - `"points"`: Points earned by the constructor in each race.
   - **Usage:** To calculate total constructor points per year.

3. **Drivers Table (`drivers`):**
   - `"driver_id"`: Unique identifier for each driver.
   - `"forename"` and `"surname"`: Driver's names.
   - **Usage:** To identify drivers associated with constructors.

4. **Driver Standings Table (`driver_standings`):**
   - `"driver_id"`: Links to the drivers table.
   - `"race_id"`: To associate standings with specific races.
   - `"points"`: Points earned by the driver in each race.
   - **Usage:** To calculate driver points per year.

5. **Results Table (`results`):**
   - `"race_id"`: Links to the races table.
   - `"driver_id"`: Links to the drivers table.
   - `"constructor_id"`: Links to the constructors table.
   - `"points"`: Points earned by the driver in a race.
   - **Usage:** To sum up the points of drivers per constructor per year.

6. **Races Table (`races`):**
   - `"race_id"`: Unique identifier for each race.
   - `"year"`: The year the race took place.
   - **Usage:** To group races and results by year.

### Potential Conditions:

- **Aggregate Points Per Year:** Sum the points for constructors and drivers per year.
- **Best Driver Per Constructor Per Year:** Identify the driver with the highest points for each constructor in each year.
- **Combined Points:** Add the constructor's points and their best driver's points per year.
- **Top 3 Constructors:** Find the top three constructors with the highest combined points.

### SQL Queries to Understand the Data:

1. **List Distinct Constructors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name" FROM "constructors" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List Distinct Years:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year" FROM "races" ORDER BY "year" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get Constructors' Standings Points:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "race_id", "points" FROM "constructor_standings" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get Drivers' Standings Points:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "race_id", "points" FROM "driver_standings" LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List Results with Drivers and Constructors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "driver_id", "constructor_id", "points" FROM "results" LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Aggregate Constructor Points Per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT races."year", results."constructor_id", SUM(results."points") AS total_constructor_points
   FROM "results"
   JOIN "races" ON results."race_id" = races."race_id"
   GROUP BY races."year", results."constructor_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Aggregate Driver Points Per Constructor Per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT races."year", results."constructor_id", results."driver_id", SUM(results."points") AS driver_points
   FROM "results"
   JOIN "races" ON results."race_id" = races."race_id"
   GROUP BY races."year", results."constructor_id", results."driver_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find Best Driver Per Constructor Per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT sub."year", sub."constructor_id", sub."driver_id", MAX(sub."driver_points") AS max_driver_points
   FROM (
     SELECT races."year", results."constructor_id", results."driver_id", SUM(results."points") AS driver_points
     FROM "results"
     JOIN "races" ON results."race_id" = races."race_id"
     GROUP BY races."year", results."constructor_id", results."driver_id"
   ) AS sub
   GROUP BY sub."year", sub."constructor_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate Combined Points For Each Constructor Per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     constructors."name",
     combined_points."year",
     (combined_points."constructor_points" + combined_points."driver_points") AS total_combined_points
   FROM (
     SELECT
       c_points."constructor_id",
       c_points."year",
       c_points."constructor_points",
       d_points."driver_id",
       d_points."driver_points"
     FROM
       (SELECT races."year", results."constructor_id", SUM(results."points") AS constructor_points
        FROM "results"
        JOIN "races" ON results."race_id" = races."race_id"
        GROUP BY races."year", results."constructor_id") AS c_points
     JOIN
       (SELECT sub."year", sub."constructor_id", sub."driver_id", MAX(sub."driver_points") AS driver_points
        FROM (
          SELECT races."year", results."constructor_id", results."driver_id", SUM(results."points") AS driver_points
          FROM "results"
          JOIN "races" ON results."race_id" = races."race_id"
          GROUP BY races."year", results."constructor_id", results."driver_id"
        ) AS sub
        GROUP BY sub."year", sub."constructor_id") AS d_points
     ON c_points."constructor_id" = d_points."constructor_id" AND c_points."year" = d_points."year"
   ) AS combined_points
   JOIN "constructors" ON combined_points."constructor_id" = "constructors"."constructor_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find Top 3 Constructors With Highest Combined Points:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      constructors."name" AS Constructor_Name,
      combined_points."year" AS Year,
      (combined_points."constructor_points" + combined_points."driver_points") AS Combined_Points
    FROM (
      SELECT
        c_points."constructor_id",
        c_points."year",
        c_points."constructor_points",
        d_points."driver_id",
        d_points."driver_points"
      FROM
        (SELECT races."year", results."constructor_id", SUM(results."points") AS constructor_points
         FROM "results"
         JOIN "races" ON results."race_id" = races."race_id"
         GROUP BY races."year", results."constructor_id") AS c_points
      JOIN
        (SELECT sub."year", sub."constructor_id", sub."driver_id", MAX(sub."driver_points") AS driver_points
         FROM (
           SELECT races."year", results."constructor_id", results."driver_id", SUM(results."points") AS driver_points
           FROM "results"
           JOIN "races" ON results."race_id" = races."race_id"
           GROUP BY races."year", results."constructor_id", results."driver_id"
         ) AS sub
         GROUP BY sub."year", sub."constructor_id") AS d_points
      ON c_points."constructor_id" = d_points."constructor_id" AND c_points."year" = d_points."year"
    ) AS combined_points
    JOIN "constructors" ON combined_points."constructor_id" = "constructors"."constructor_id"
    ORDER BY Combined_Points DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively build up to understanding how to calculate the combined points of constructors and their best drivers per year. The final query (Query 10) aims to find the top 3 constructors with the highest combined points by summing the constructor's points and the points of their best-performing driver for each year.

Task: Which constructors had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and in which years did they achieve them?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Constructor_Name,Year,Combined_Points
constructor1:str,year1:int,combined_points1:float
constructor2:str,year2:int,combined_points2:float
constructor3:str,year3:int,combined_points3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above lists the top 3 constructors with the highest combined points from their best driver and team, along with the years they achieved them..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 10:00:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which constructors had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and in which years did they achieve them?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Constructor_Name,Year,Combined_Points
constructor1:str,year1:int,combined_points1:float
constructor2:str,year2:int,combined_points2:float
constructor3:str,year3:int,combined_points3:float

The table above lists the top 3 constructors with the highest combined points from their best driver and team, along with the years they achieved them. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
