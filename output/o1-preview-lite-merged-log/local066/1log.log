2025-01-24 08:09:59 - root - INFO - The error in your query occurs because you're referencing a column `"pr"."toppings"` that doesn't exist in the subquery aliased as `"pr"`. In your subquery, `"pr"` only contains the columns `"order_id"`, `"pizza_id"`, and `"cancellation"`. The `"toppings"` column is actually in the `"pizza_recipes"` table, which you've aliased as `"r"`.

To fix the error, you should reference `"r"."toppings"` instead of `"pr"."toppings"` in your SELECT statement. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT "pr"."order_id", "pr"."pizza_id", "r"."toppings"
FROM (
  SELECT "pc"."order_id", "pc"."pizza_id", "pr"."cancellation"
  FROM "pizza_customer_orders" AS "pc"
  JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" AS "pr" ON "pc"."order_id" = "pr"."order_id"
  WHERE "pr"."cancellation" IS NULL
) AS "pr"
JOIN "pizza_recipes" AS "r" ON "pr"."pizza_id" = "r"."pizza_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

Alternatively, you can simplify the query by combining the tables without the subquery:

```sql
SELECT "pc"."order_id", "pc"."pizza_id", "r"."toppings"
FROM "pizza_customer_orders" AS "pc"
JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" AS "pr" ON "pc"."order_id" = "pr"."order_id"
JOIN "pizza_recipes" AS "r" ON "pc"."pizza_id" = "r"."pizza_id"
WHERE "pr"."cancellation" IS NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

This query selects the `"order_id"`, `"pizza_id"`, and `"toppings"` for all delivered orders (where `"cancellation"` is `NULL`), correctly referencing the `"toppings"` column from the `"pizza_recipes"` table.

**Explanation:**

- **Issue Identification:**
  - The subquery aliased as `"pr"` does not include a `"toppings"` column.
  - Attempting to select `"pr"."toppings"` results in a "no such column" error.

- **Solution:**
  - Reference the `"toppings"` column from the correct table (`"pizza_recipes"`), which is aliased as `"r"`.
  - Adjust the SELECT statement to use `"r"."toppings"`.

- **Simplification:**
  - By removing the subquery and directly joining the tables, the query becomes more straightforward and easier to understand.

**Next Steps:**

Now that we have successfully retrieved the base toppings for each delivered pizza, you can proceed to:

1. **Process the Exclusions and Extras:**
   - Parse the `"exclusions"` and `"extras"` columns from `"pizza_customer_orders"` to adjust the toppings for each order.
   - These columns may contain comma-separated values that need to be split into individual topping IDs.

2. **Combine Toppings per Order:**
   - For each order, subtract the excluded toppings and add the extra toppings to the base recipe.
   - This will give you the final list of toppings used for each delivered pizza.

3. **Aggregate Ingredient Usage:**
   - Flatten all the topping IDs from the adjusted orders.
   - Map the topping IDs to their names using the `"pizza_toppings"` table.
   - Count the occurrences of each topping to get the total quantity used.

4. **Prepare the Final Output:**
   - Summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the delivered pizzas.
   - Output the results with the ingredient names and their corresponding quantities.

By following these steps, you'll be able to summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas you delivered, as per your task requirements.

2025-01-24 08:12:23 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering:

```
near "ON": syntax error
```

indicates that there's a problem with the syntax of your `ON` clause in the `JOIN` statement.

### Issue Explanation:

In your query:

```sql
SELECT "t"."topping_name"
FROM "pizza_recipes" AS "r"
JOIN "pizza_toppings" AS "t"
  ON ',' || "r"."toppings" || ',' LIKE '%,' || CAST("t"."topping_id" AS TEXT) || ',%'
WHERE "r"."pizza_id" = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

The error occurs because the condition in the `ON` clause is not properly enclosed. SQL requires that complex conditions in the `ON` clause be wrapped in parentheses to ensure correct parsing.

### Corrected Query:

To fix the syntax error, wrap the condition in the `ON` clause within parentheses:

```sql
SELECT "t"."topping_name"
FROM "pizza_recipes" AS "r"
JOIN "pizza_toppings" AS "t"
  ON (',' || "r"."toppings" || ',' LIKE '%,' || CAST("t"."topping_id" AS TEXT) || ',%')
WHERE "r"."pizza_id" = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

### Alternative Approach Using `instr` Function:

Alternatively, you can use the `instr` function for pattern matching, which can be cleaner and more efficient:

```sql
SELECT "t"."topping_name"
FROM "pizza_recipes" AS "r"
JOIN "pizza_toppings" AS "t"
  ON instr(',' || "r"."toppings" || ',', ',' || CAST("t"."topping_id" AS TEXT) || ',') > 0
WHERE "r"."pizza_id" = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:

- **Wrapping Condition in Parentheses:**
  - **Why?** SQL requires that expressions in the `ON` clause be properly enclosed. Without parentheses, the parser may not interpret the condition correctly, leading to a syntax error.
  - **How?** By adding parentheses around the entire condition:
    ```sql
    ON (condition)
    ```

- **Using the `instr` Function:**
  - **Why?** The `instr` function checks for the presence of one string within another and returns the position if found (greater than 0), or 0 if not found.
  - **How?**
    - Concatenate commas around the `toppings` list and the `topping_id` to prevent partial matches.
    - The condition:
      ```sql
      instr(',' || "r"."toppings" || ',', ',' || CAST("t"."topping_id" AS TEXT) || ',') > 0
      ```
      checks if the `topping_id` exists within the comma-separated `toppings` list.

### Steps to Verify:

1. **Run the Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "t"."topping_name"
   FROM "pizza_recipes" AS "r"
   JOIN "pizza_toppings" AS "t"
     ON (',' || "r"."toppings" || ',' LIKE '%,' || CAST("t"."topping_id" AS TEXT) || ',%')
   WHERE "r"."pizza_id" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Expected Results:**

   The query should now run without errors and return the topping names for the pizza with `pizza_id = 1`.

### Note on Working with Comma-Separated Values:

- **Challenges:**
  - Storing lists in a comma-separated string can make querying more complex and less efficient.
  - SQL is not optimized for parsing and manipulating strings as lists.

- **Recommendation:**
  - **Data Normalization:**
    - Consider redesigning the database schema for better normalization.
    - Create a separate table (e.g., `pizza_recipe_toppings`) where each row represents a single topping for a pizza recipe.
    - This allows for simpler and more efficient queries using standard JOINs.

### Example of a Normalized Schema:

- **`pizza_recipes` Table:**

  | pizza_id | pizza_name   |
  |----------|--------------|
  | 1        | Meat Lovers  |
  | 2        | Vegetarian   |

- **`pizza_recipe_toppings` Table:**

  | pizza_id | topping_id |
  |----------|------------|
  | 1        | 1          |
  | 1        | 2          |
  | 1        | 3          |
  | ...      | ...        |
  | 2        | 4          |
  | 2        | 6          |

- **`pizza_toppings` Table:**

  | topping_id | topping_name |
  |------------|--------------|
  | 1          | Bacon        |
  | 2          | BBQ Sauce    |
  | ...        | ...          |

- **Rewritten Query Using Normalized Tables:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "t"."topping_name"
  FROM "pizza_recipes" AS "r"
  JOIN "pizza_recipe_toppings" AS "rt" ON "r"."pizza_id" = "rt"."pizza_id"
  JOIN "pizza_toppings" AS "t" ON "rt"."topping_id" = "t"."topping_id"
  WHERE "r"."pizza_id" = 1
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

### Conclusion:

By correcting the syntax in your `ON` clause and considering schema normalization, you can resolve the error and simplify future queries. This will make it easier to manipulate and analyze your data effectively.

- **"pizza_customer_orders"."order_id"**: Identifies each customer order.
  - **Usage**: To link customer orders with pizzas and any modifications (exclusions/extras).
- **"pizza_customer_orders"."pizza_id"**: Indicates the type of pizza ordered.
  - **Usage**: To retrieve the base toppings from "pizza_recipes".
- **"pizza_customer_orders"."exclusions"**: Toppings to exclude from the pizza.
  - **Usage**: To adjust the base toppings by removing specified toppings.
- **"pizza_customer_orders"."extras"**: Additional toppings requested for the pizza.
  - **Usage**: To add extra toppings to the base recipe.
- **"pizza_runner_orders"."order_id"**: Links to the customer orders.
  - **Usage**: To determine which orders were delivered (where "cancellation" is NULL).
- **"pizza_runner_orders"."cancellation"**: Indicates if the order was canceled.
  - **Usage**: To filter out canceled orders.
- **"pizza_recipes"."pizza_id"**: Identifies the pizza recipe.
  - **Usage**: To get the base toppings for each pizza.

   FROM "pizza_customer_orders"
   WHERE "exclusions" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Identify orders where customers requested toppings to be excluded.*

6. **Find orders with extras:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "order_id", "pizza_id", "extras"
   FROM "pizza_customer_orders"
   WHERE "extras" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Identify orders where customers requested extra toppings.*

Task: Based on our customer pizza order information, summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas we delivered. Output the name and quantity for each ingredient.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Ingredient_Name,Total_Quantity
ingredient1:str,quantity1:int
ingredient2:str,quantity2:int
...
```

To summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas we delivered, we combined the base toppings from each pizza recipe with any modifications from customer orders, including exclusions and extras. This allowed us to aggregate the total usage of each ingredient across all delivered pizzas..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 08:14:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Based on our customer pizza order information, summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas we delivered. Output the name and quantity for each ingredient., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Ingredient_Name,Total_Quantity
ingredient1:str,quantity1:int
ingredient2:str,quantity2:int
...
```

To summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas we delivered, we combined the base toppings from each pizza recipe with any modifications from customer orders, including exclusions and extras. This allowed us to aggregate the total usage of each ingredient across all delivered pizzas. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
