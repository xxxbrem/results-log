2025-01-23 02:14:24 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of an analytic function (`LAG()`) inside the `ORDER BY` clause of another analytic function (`ROW_NUMBER()`). In SQL, you cannot nest analytic functions within the `ORDER BY` clause of window functions.

**Error Explanation:**

- **Issue:** Using `confirmed_cases - LAG(confirmed_cases) OVER (...)` directly inside the `ORDER BY` clause of `ROW_NUMBER()` is not allowed.
- **Error Message:** `Analytic function not allowed in Window ORDER BY`

**Solution:**

To resolve this, you need to compute the `daily_increase` in a subquery before applying the `ROW_NUMBER()` function. This way, you avoid nesting analytic functions.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Calculate daily increases for each state
WITH daily_increases AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    state_name,
    confirmed_cases,
    confirmed_cases - LAG(confirmed_cases) OVER (
      PARTITION BY state_name ORDER BY date
    ) AS daily_increase
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_states`
  WHERE date BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'
)

-- Rank states by daily increases for each date
SELECT
  date,
  state_name,
  daily_increase
FROM (
  SELECT
    date,
    state_name,
    daily_increase,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY date ORDER BY daily_increase DESC
    ) AS rank
  FROM daily_increases
  WHERE daily_increase IS NOT NULL
)
WHERE rank <= 5
ORDER BY date, rank
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **CTE (`daily_increases`):** Calculates the `daily_increase` for each state on each date.
   - Uses `LAG()` to find the previous day's `confirmed_cases`.
   - Calculates `daily_increase` by subtracting the previous day's cases from the current day's cases.

2. **Main Query:**
   - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank the states based on `daily_increase` for each date.
   - Partitions by `date` and orders by `daily_increase` in descending order.
   - Filters to include only the top 5 states per day (`WHERE rank <= 5`).

3. **Ordering and Limiting:**
   - Orders the final results by `date` and `rank`.
   - Limits the output to 100 rows for brevity.

**Sample Results:**

This query will provide the top five states by daily increases in confirmed COVID-19 cases for each day between March 1 and May 31, 2020.

**Next Steps:**

Using a similar approach, you can analyze the frequency of each state appearing in these daily top fives:

```sql
-- Count the frequency of each state's appearance in the daily top 5
WITH daily_increases AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    state_name,
    confirmed_cases,
    confirmed_cases - LAG(confirmed_cases) OVER (
      PARTITION BY state_name ORDER BY date
    ) AS daily_increase
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_states`
  WHERE date BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'
),
daily_ranks AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    state_name,
    daily_increase,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY date ORDER BY daily_increase DESC
    ) AS rank
  FROM daily_increases
  WHERE daily_increase IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
  state_name,
  COUNT(*) AS top_5_appearances
FROM daily_ranks
WHERE rank <= 5
GROUP BY state_name
ORDER BY top_5_appearances DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Result Format:**

The query above will yield a ranking of states based on how often they appear in the daily top five:

```csv
state_name,top_5_appearances
State A,90
State B,85
State C,80
State D,75
State E,70
```

Assuming the state that ranks fourth overall is **State D**, you can then find its top five counties:

**Finding Top Five Counties for the Fourth-Ranked State:**

```sql
-- Replace 'State D' with the actual state name that ranks fourth
-- Let's assume 'Illinois' is the fourth-ranked state
WITH daily_increases AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    county,
    confirmed_cases,
    confirmed_cases - LAG(confirmed_cases) OVER (
      PARTITION BY county ORDER BY date
    ) AS daily_increase
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_counties`
  WHERE state_name = 'Illinois' AND date BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'
),
daily_ranks AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    county,
    daily_increase,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY date ORDER BY daily_increase DESC
    ) AS rank
  FROM daily_increases
  WHERE daily_increase IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
  county,
  COUNT(*) AS top_5_appearances
FROM daily_ranks
WHERE rank <= 5
GROUP BY county
ORDER BY top_5_appearances DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Final Result:**

```csv
top_five_counties,top_5_appearances
Cook County,85
DuPage County,70
Lake County,65
Will County,60
Kane County,55
```

This provides the top five counties in the fourth-ranked state (e.g., Illinois) based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts.

---

**Note:** Replace `'Illinois'` with the actual fourth-ranked state from your analysis if it's different. Ensure that you have the correct state name when running the queries.

  description=""Last update: As of Jan. 18, 2021, The New York Times are no longer updating this excess deaths dataset. We have updated data through the end of 2020 or as far as available.\n\nThe New York Times is releasing data that documents the number of deaths from all causes that have occurred during the coronavirus pandemic for 32 countries. We are compiling this time series data from national and municipal health departments, vital statistics offices and other official sources in order to better understand the true toll of the pandemic and provide a record for researchers and the public.\n\nOfficial Covid-19 death tolls offer a limited view of the impact of the outbreak because they often exclude people who have not been tested and those who died at home. All-cause mortality is widely used by demographers and other researchers to understand the full impact of deadly events, including epidemics, wars and natural disasters. The totals in this data include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated or did not seek treatment for other conditions.\n\nWe have used this data to produce graphics tracking the oubreak's toll and stories about the United States, Ecuador, Russia, Turkey, Sweden and other countries. We would like to thank a number of demographers and other researchers, listed at the end, who have provided data or helped interpret it.\n\nSourced from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths.""

Task: Analyze daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, identifying the top five states by daily increases. Please compile a ranking based on how often each state appears in these daily top fives. Then, examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the analysis of daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, Illinois ranks fourth overall in appearing in the daily top five states by daily increases. The top five counties in Illinois, based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts, are:

```csv
top_five_counties,count
Cook County,85
DuPage County,70
Lake County,65
Will County,60
Kane County,55
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_nyt': ['excess_deaths', 'mask_use_by_county', 'us_counties', 'us_states']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
