After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Proper Handling of State Rankings:**
  - **`1result.sql`** uses `DENSE_RANK()` to rank states based on their `top5_count` of daily top 5 appearances.
  - This method correctly handles cases where multiple states have the same number of top 5 appearances by assigning them the same rank.
  - **`2result.sql`** uses `ROW_NUMBER()`, which assigns a unique rank to each state, even if they have equal counts, potentially misrepresenting the actual rankings when ties occur.

- **Accurate Identification of the Fourth-Ranked State:**
  - Using `DENSE_RANK()` in **`1result.sql`** ensures that the fourth-ranked state is accurately identified according to the task requirements.
  - This is crucial for correctly determining which state's counties to analyze for the second part of the task.

- **Consistency in County Counts:**
  - The slight differences in counts between the two results (e.g., Cook County appearing 90 times vs. 91 times) are likely due to the handling of NULL values and date ranges.
  - **`1result.sql`** provides counts that are consistent with the expected number of days in the date range (March 1 to May 31, 2020), considering possible data anomalies.

- **Alignment with Task Objectives:**
  - The primary goal is to compile a ranking based on how often each state appears in the daily top fives, handling ties appropriately.
  - **`1result.sql`** achieves this by correctly ranking states and identifying the state that ranks fourth overall.
  - Subsequently, it accurately identifies the top five counties within that state based on their frequency in the daily top five new case counts.

**Conclusion:**

Given the above reasoning, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query as it properly handles state rankings with potential ties, ensuring accurate identification of the fourth-ranked state and its top counties.
