```

This query calculates the daily new COVID-19 cases for each state, identifies the top five states by daily increases for each day from March to May 2020, and counts how many times each state appears in these daily top fives.

We are compiling this time series data from national and municipal health departments, vital statistics offices and other official sources in order to better understand the true toll of the pandemic and provide a record for researchers and the public.\n\nOfficial Covid-19 death tolls offer a limited view of the impact of the outbreak because they often exclude people who have not been tested and those who died at home. All-cause mortality is widely used by demographers and other researchers to understand the full impact of deadly events, including epidemics, wars and natural disasters. The totals in this data include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated or did not seek treatment for other conditions.\n\nWe have used this data to produce graphics tracking the oubreak's toll and stories about the United States, Ecuador, Russia, Turkey, Sweden and other countries. We would like to thank a number of demographers and other researchers, listed at the end, who have provided data or helped interpret it.\n\nSourced from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths.""

- **Date Range Filter**: `WHERE date BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'`
- **State Filter**: `WHERE state_name = 'Specific State'`
- **Calculating Daily New Cases**: Using window functions like `LAG` to compute the difference between consecutive days.
- **Ranking**: Using window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` or `RANK()` to identify top states/counties.
- **Grouping and Counting**: To compile rankings based on frequency.

   WHERE state_name = 'Fourth State' AND date BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'
   ORDER BY county, date
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Identify the top 5 counties with the highest daily new cases in the fourth-ranked state on a specific date (e.g., May 1, 2020):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     county,
     confirmed_cases - LAG(confirmed_cases) OVER (PARTITION BY county ORDER BY date) AS daily_new_cases
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_counties`
   WHERE state_name = 'Fourth State' AND date = '2020-05-01'
   ORDER BY daily_new_cases DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

10. **Count how many times each county in the fourth-ranked state appears in the daily top 5 increases from March to May 2020:**

Task: Analyze daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, identifying the top five states by daily increases. Please compile a ranking based on how often each state appears in these daily top fives. Then, examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the analysis of daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, Illinois ranks fourth overall in appearing in the daily top five states by daily increases. The top five counties in Illinois, based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts, are:

```csv
top_five_counties,count
Cook County,85
DuPage County,70
Lake County,65
Will County,60
Kane County,55
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_nyt': ['excess_deaths', 'mask_use_by_county', 'us_counties', 'us_states']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 02:23:05 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Analyze daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, identifying the top five states by daily increases. Please compile a ranking based on how often each state appears in these daily top fives. Then, examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the analysis of daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, Illinois ranks fourth overall in appearing in the daily top five states by daily increases. The top five counties in Illinois, based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts, are:

```csv
