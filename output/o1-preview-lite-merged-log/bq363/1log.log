Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `trip_seconds`: Used to calculate trip duration. We'll convert it to minutes and round to the nearest whole number.
- `fare`: Used to calculate the average fare for each quantile.
- `trip_total`: Could be used if we wanted the total trip cost including tips and extras.
- `unique_key`: Can be used to count total number of trips.
- `trip_start_timestamp`, `trip_end_timestamp`: Could be used for additional time-based filtering or calculations.

**Conditions:**

- `trip_seconds` is not null and greater than 0 (to ensure valid durations).
- Duration in minutes (rounded) is between 1 and 50 inclusive.
- Trips are divided into 10 quantiles based on the duration in minutes.

---

**BigQuery SQL Queries:**

1. **Select trip durations and fares for all trips:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     trip_seconds,
     fare
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Calculate trip duration in minutes (rounded) and include fare:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     trip_seconds,
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes,
     fare
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Filter trips with positive trip seconds:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     trip_seconds,
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes,
     fare
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Filter trips with duration between 1 and 50 minutes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     trip_seconds,
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes,
     fare
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select distinct rounded duration minutes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count trips per rounded duration minute:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes,
     COUNT(*) AS total_trips
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds > 0
   GROUP BY
     duration_minutes
   ORDER BY
     duration_minutes
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate average fare per rounded duration minute:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes,
     AVG(fare) AS average_fare
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds > 0
     AND fare IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY
     duration_minutes
   ORDER BY
     duration_minutes
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Assign trips to quantiles based on duration:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     trip_seconds,
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes,
     NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY ROUND(trip_seconds / 60)) AS duration_quantile,
     fare
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate total trips and average fare per quantile:**

   ```sql

    ORDER BY
      duration_range
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Select trips with fare greater than a certain amount:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      trip_seconds,
      ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes,
      fare
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      trip_seconds > 0
      AND fare > 50
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find the maximum fare for trips between 1 and 50 minutes:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      MAX(fare) AS max_fare
    FROM (
      SELECT
        fare,
        ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes

        AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Identify unique payment types used in trips:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT
      payment_type
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Calculate average trip miles per duration quantile:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      duration_quantile,
      AVG(trip_miles) AS average_miles
    FROM (
      SELECT
        trip_miles,
        ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes,
        NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY ROUND(trip_seconds / 60)) AS duration_quantile
      FROM

        trip_seconds > 0
        AND trip_miles > 0
        AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
    )
    GROUP BY
      duration_quantile
    ORDER BY
      duration_quantile
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: For taxi trips with a duration rounded to the nearest minute, and between 1 and 50 minutes, if the trip durations are divided into 10 quantiles, what are the total number of trips and the average fare for each quantile?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Duration_Range_Minutes,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
quantile_range1:str,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
quantile_range2:str,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
quantile_range3:str,total_trips3:int,average_fare3:float
quantile_range4:str,total_trips4:int,average_fare4:float
quantile_range5:str,total_trips5:int,average_fare5:float
quantile_range6:str,total_trips6:int,average_fare6:float
quantile_range7:str,total_trips7:int,average_fare7:float
quantile_range8:str,total_trips8:int,average_fare8:float
quantile_range9:str,total_trips9:int,average_fare9:float
quantile_range10:str,total_trips10:int,average_fare10:float
```

In the table above, **Duration_Range_Minutes** represents the range of trip durations for each of the 10 quantiles between 1 and 50 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute). **Total_Trips** is the total number of trips within each quantile, and **Average_Fare** is the average fare for trips in each quantile..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 05:28:50 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For taxi trips with a duration rounded to the nearest minute, and between 1 and 50 minutes, if the trip durations are divided into 10 quantiles, what are the total number of trips and the average fare for each quantile?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Duration_Range_Minutes,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
quantile_range1:str,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
quantile_range2:str,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float

quantile_range9:str,total_trips9:int,average_fare9:float
quantile_range10:str,total_trips10:int,average_fare10:float
```

In the table above, **Duration_Range_Minutes** represents the range of trip durations for each of the 10 quantiles between 1 and 50 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute). **Total_Trips** is the total number of trips within each quantile, and **Average_Fare** is the average fare for trips in each quantile. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
