After comparing both SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the correct and preferred answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Use of Explicit JOINs:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses explicit `JOIN` statements with `ON` clauses to join tables and datasets.
   - This approach is clearer and more standard compared to using commas in the `FROM` clause, which can lead to implicit cross joins.
   - Explicit joins improve readability and maintainability of the SQL code.

2. **Query Efficiency:**
   - By using explicit `JOIN` operations, **`2result.sql`** ensures that the query planner can optimize the query execution plan more effectively.
   - This can lead to better performance, especially on large datasets.

3. **Clarity and SQL Best Practices:**
   - **`2result.sql`** follows SQL best practices by:
     - Clearly specifying join conditions.
     - Avoiding potential confusion or errors that can arise from implicit joins.
   - This makes the query easier to understand for others who may read or maintain the code in the future.

4. **Equivalent Results:**
   - Both queries return the same result (`number_of_distinct_users = 37165`), confirming that they are functionally equivalent in terms of output.
   - However, the approach in **`2result.sql`** is more robust and aligns with best practices.

**Conclusion:**

Given the reasons above, **`2result.sql`** is the correct and better-structured query to use.
