Upon comparing the SQL queries and their results:

- **`0result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`** produce identical results:
  - **Average_log2_h4_h3**: 11.3198
  - **Variance_log2_h4_h3**: 0.0073
  - **Max_min_difference_log2_h4_h3**: 0.1813
  - **QTL_source_right_study_of_max_log2_h4_h3**: PhLiPS

- **`2result.sql`** has a slightly different variance:
  - **Variance_log2_h4_h3**: 0.0109

The difference in variance arises because **`2result.sql`** uses `VAR_SAMP` (sample variance), while **`0result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`** use `VAR_POP` (population variance). Since we're considering all data points that meet the specified conditions (i.e., the entire population under those conditions), **`VAR_POP`** is the appropriate function to use.

Additionally, **`0result.sql`** is straightforward and doesn't use unnecessary common table expressions (CTEs), making it more efficient.

**Therefore, `0result.sql` is the correct SQL query.**
