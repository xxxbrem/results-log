After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, it's clear that both `0result.sql` and `1result.sql` accurately identify the single team with the fewest wins in each league. However, there are some differences in their approaches:

**`0result.sql`:**
- Utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate wins per team and finds teams with the minimum wins.
- Uses a `CASE` statement to determine the winning team directly in a single query.

**`1result.sql`:**
- Separately calculates home wins and away wins for each team and then sums them to get total wins.
- Uses nested subqueries to first calculate total wins per team per league and then identifies the minimum wins.
- This method is more consistent with standard SQL practices, making it easier to understand and maintain.

**Reason for selecting `1result.sql`:**
- **Clarity and Maintainability:** By separately calculating home and away wins before summing them, `1result.sql` provides a clearer and more structured approach.
- **Consistency with Previous Queries:** This method aligns with the step-by-step approach used in the earlier queries provided, ensuring consistency.
- **Ease of Debugging:** Breaking down the calculations makes it easier to troubleshoot and validate each step of the query.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script to identify the single team with the fewest wins in each league.
