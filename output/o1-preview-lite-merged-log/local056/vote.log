Both SQL queries aim to identify the customer with the highest average monthly change in payment amounts. Here's a comparison of the two:

**First SQL (`0result.sql`):**

- **Calculations:**
  - Computes monthly total payments per customer.
  - Uses `LAG` to find the previous month's total payments for each customer.
  - Calculates the monthly change by subtracting the previous month's total from the current month's total.
  - Takes the absolute value of these changes.
  - Calculates the average of these absolute monthly changes per customer.
- **Result:** Selects the customer with the maximum average monthly change.

**Second SQL (`1result.sql`):**

- **Calculations:**
  - Computes monthly total payments per customer.
  - Uses `LAG` to compute the change in payment amounts between consecutive months for each customer.
  - Takes the absolute value of these changes.
  - Calculates the average of these changes per customer.
- **Result:** Identifies the customer with the highest average monthly change.

**Reason for Choosing `1result.sql`:**

- **Conciseness:** The second SQL is more concise, making it easier to read and understand.
- **Efficiency:** It avoids unnecessary rounding and extra Common Table Expressions (CTEs), potentially improving performance.
- **Clarity:** The logic flows directly from calculating monthly totals to computing changes and averaging them.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct and more optimal query.
