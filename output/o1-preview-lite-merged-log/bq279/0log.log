Begin Exploring Related Columns
Relevant Tables and Columns:

- **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
  - **`station_id`**: Unique identifier for each station. *Potential usage*: Identify distinct stations.
  - **`status`**: Status of the station (e.g., 'active', 'closed'). *Potential usage*: Determine if a station is active or closed.
  - **`modified_date`**: Timestamp of the last modification. *Potential usage*: Assess when a station’s status was last updated.

- **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
  - **`start_station_id`**: Station where the trip started. *Potential usage*: Identify stations active during trips in specific years.
  - **`end_station_id`**: Station where the trip ended. *Potential usage*: Identify stations active during trips in specific years.
  - **`start_time`**: Timestamp when the trip started. *Potential usage*: Filter trips by year (2013, 2014).

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filter by Year**: Use `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time)` to select trips in 2013 and 2014.
- **Station Activity**: Determine station activity based on trip records in a given year.
- **Status Filtering**: Use `status` to identify active or closed stations.
- **Distinct Counts**: Use `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to count unique stations.

Here are SQL queries to understand the data:

1. **List distinct station statuses in the stations table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT status
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT station_id, status, modified_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count stations with `modified_date` in or before 2013:**

   ```sql

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_active
2013,num_active:int,num_closed:int
2014,num_active:int,num_closed:int
(Attention: answer in this order)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The year (2013 or 2014).

- **Number_of_Stations_active** (first column): The number of distinct active bike share stations for the given year.

- **Number_of_Stations_active** (second column): The number of distinct closed bike share stations for the given year.

- We followed the specified format provided in the task.

**Note:**

- Without historical status data for each station, we cannot provide the exact numbers of active and closed stations for each year from the given data..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'austin_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'austin_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_stations', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'austin_crime': ['crime'], 'austin_incidents': ['incidents_2008', 'incidents_2009', 'incidents_2010', 'incidents_2011', 'incidents_2016'], 'austin_waste': ['waste_and_diversion']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 20:54:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_active
2013,num_active:int,num_closed:int
2014,num_active:int,num_closed:int

- We followed the specified format provided in the task.

**Note:**

- Without historical status data for each station, we cannot provide the exact numbers of active and closed stations for each year from the given data. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
