```

**Explanation of the Correction:**

- **Removed Extra Backtick and Semicolon:**
  - The extra backtick (\`) and semicolon (;) at the end of your query caused the SQL parser to think there's an unclosed string literal. By removing them, the query syntax is corrected.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that all string literals are properly closed.
- The corrected query now should run without syntax errors and produce the desired results.

**This query retrieves the latest ride data for each region between 2014 and 2017**, providing the region name, trip ID, duration, start time, starting station, and rider gender.

Task: Find the latest ride data for each region between 2014 and 2017. I want to know the name of each region, the trip ID of this ride, the ride duration, the start time, the starting station, and the gender of the rider.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To find the latest ride data for each region between 2014 and 2017, the information can be presented in the following format:

```csv
Region_Name,Trip_ID,Duration_Seconds,Start_Time,Start_Station_Name,Rider_Gender
region_name1:str,trip_id1:str,duration1:int,start_time1:datetime,start_station1:str,gender1:str
region_name2:str,trip_id2:str,duration2:int,start_time2:datetime,start_station2:str,gender2:str
...
(Attention: one row per region)
```

This table includes the name of each region, the trip ID of the latest ride in that region within the specified date range, the duration of the ride in seconds, the start time of the ride, the name of the starting station, and the gender of the rider..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'san_francisco_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'san_francisco_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_regions', 'bikeshare_station_info', 'bikeshare_station_status', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'san_francisco_film_locations': ['film_locations'], 'san_francisco_neighborhoods': ['boundaries'], 'san_francisco_sffd_service_calls': ['sffd_service_calls'], 'san_francisco_sfpd_incidents': ['sfpd_incidents'], 'san_francisco_transit_muni': ['calendar', 'fares', 'routes', 'shapes', 'stop_monitoring', 'stop_times', 'stops', 'trips', 'vehicle_monitoring'], 'san_francisco_trees': ['street_trees']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-22 23:13:49 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Find the latest ride data for each region between 2014 and 2017. I want to know the name of each region, the trip ID of this ride, the ride duration, the start time, the starting station, and the gender of the rider., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the latest ride data for each region between 2014 and 2017, the information can be presented in the following format:

```csv
Region_Name,Trip_ID,Duration_Seconds,Start_Time,Start_Station_Name,Rider_Gender

region_name2:str,trip_id2:str,duration2:int,start_time2:datetime,start_station2:str,gender2:str
...
(Attention: one row per region)
```

This table includes the name of each region, the trip ID of the latest ride in that region within the specified date range, the duration of the ride in seconds, the start time of the ride, the name of the starting station, and the gender of the rider. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
