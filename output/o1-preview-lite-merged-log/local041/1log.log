To determine the percentage of trees in the Bronx with a health status of **Good**, we'll analyze the data in the **"trees"** table.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table "trees"**: Contains detailed information about trees in different boroughs.
  - **"boroname"**: Indicates the borough where each tree is located. We'll use this column to filter trees in the Bronx.
  - **"health"**: Represents the health status of each tree. We'll use this column to identify trees with a health status of 'Good'.
  - **"tree_id"**: Unique identifier for each tree. Useful for counting trees.
  - **"spc_common"**: Common species name of the tree. Can be used for additional insights.
  - **"zipcode"**: ZIP code where the tree is located. May be helpful for granular analysis.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx'**: To select trees located in the Bronx.
- **WHERE "health" = 'Good'**: To select trees with a health status of 'Good'.
- **GROUP BY**, **COUNT()**, and **DISTINCT**: For aggregating and counting unique entries.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

Below are 10 SQL queries, ranging from simple to complex, to help us understand the data related to the task.

1. **List all distinct borough names in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "boroname" FROM "trees" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all distinct health statuses of trees:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "health" FROM "trees" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the total number of trees in the Bronx:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "trees" WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx' LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the total number of trees in the Bronx with health status 'Good':**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "trees" WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx' AND "health" = 'Good' LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get the number of trees in the Bronx grouped by health status:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "health", COUNT(*) FROM "trees" WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx' GROUP BY "health" LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate the percentage of each health status among trees in the Bronx:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "health",
     100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "trees" WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx') AS "percentage"
   FROM "trees"
   WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx'
   GROUP BY "health"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List the unique tree species (common names) in the Bronx with health status 'Good':**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "spc_common" FROM "trees" WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx' AND "health" = 'Good' LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the number of trees for each species in the Bronx with health status 'Good':**

   ```sql
   SELECT "spc_common", COUNT(*) FROM "trees" WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx' AND "health" = 'Good' GROUP BY "spc_common" LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List ZIP codes in the Bronx and the number of 'Good' health trees in each:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "zipcode", COUNT(*) FROM "trees" WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx' AND "health" = 'Good' GROUP BY "zipcode" LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get the total number of trees and number of 'Good' health trees in each borough:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      "boroname",
      COUNT(*) AS "total_trees",
      SUM(CASE WHEN "health" = 'Good' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "good_health_trees"
    FROM "trees"
    GROUP BY "boroname"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us understand:

- The different boroughs and health statuses present in the dataset.
- The total number of trees in the Bronx.
- The number and percentage of trees in 'Good' health in the Bronx.
- Additional insights like species distribution and ZIP code distribution of healthy trees.

Using the results from queries 3 and 4, we can calculate the percentage of trees in the Bronx that have a health status of 'Good' by dividing the count from query 4 by the count from query 3 and multiplying by 100.

---

Finally, combining the counts:

```sql
SELECT
  100.0 * (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "trees" WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx' AND "health" = 'Good'
  ) / (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "trees" WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx'
  ) AS "percentage_good_trees_in_Bronx"
LIMIT 100;
```

This final query directly calculates the percentage of trees in the Bronx with a health status of 'Good'.Query:

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
percentage_good_trees_in_Bronx
value:float
```

To calculate the percentage of trees in the Bronx with a health status of **Good**, divide the number of trees with **health = 'Good'** by the total number of trees in the Bronx and multiply by 100..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 15:52:43 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What percentage of trees in the Bronx have a health status of Good?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
percentage_good_trees_in_Bronx
value:float
```

To calculate the percentage of trees in the Bronx with a health status of **Good**, divide the number of trees with **health = 'Good'** by the total number of trees in the Bronx and multiply by 100. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
