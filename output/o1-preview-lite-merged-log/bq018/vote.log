After comparing the three SQL queries, I recommend **1result.sql** as the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

- **1result.sql**:
  - It aggregates the data using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `daily_data`, ensuring that for each date, the maximum cumulative confirmed cases are considered. This handles any potential duplicates or anomalies in the data.
  - It calculates the growth rate precisely by taking the difference between the current and previous day's cumulative confirmed cases and divides by the previous day's cumulative confirmed cases.
  - The use of `QUALIFY` ensures that only records with a valid previous cumulative value are considered, enhancing the query's robustness.

- **0result.sql** and **2result.sql** also calculate the growth rate, but they might not handle duplicate entries or data anomalies as robustly as **1result.sql**. While all three queries yield the same result, **1result.sql** provides a more reliable and precise approach by grouping and aggregating the data appropriately.

Therefore, the recommended SQL is:

1result.sql
