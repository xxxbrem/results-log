After carefully analyzing the three SQL queries and their results, we can determine which one correctly fulfills the task:

**Task:** Provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile.

### **Comparison of the SQL Queries and Their Results**

**Option 0:**

- **SQL (0result.sql):**
  - Assigns quintiles using a manual `CASE` statement based on row numbers (`ROW_NUMBER()`).
  - Divides the students into quintiles with fixed rank ranges:
    - Ranks 1-4: Quintile 5
    - Ranks 5-8: Quintile 4
    - Ranks 9-11: Quintile 3
    - Ranks 12-14: Quintile 2
    - Ranks 15 and above: Quintile 1
- **Result:**
  - May not evenly distribute students into quintiles.
  - Less dynamic; hardcoded ranges may not adjust well if the number of students changes.

**Option 1:**

- **SQL (1result.sql):**
  - Uses the `NTILE(5)` window function to assign quintiles based on students' grades.
  - Reverses the quintile numbering with `(6 - NTILE(5))` so that quintile 5 is the highest.
  - Distributes students as evenly as possible into five groups.
- **Result:**
  - Provides an even distribution of students into quintiles.
  - Ranks are dynamically assigned based on the total number of students.
  - Adjusts automatically if the number of students changes.

**Option 2:**

- **SQL (2result.sql):**
  - Calculates the average grade per student (which is unnecessary if each student has only one grade in English courses).
  - Uses `NTILE(5)` over the average grades.
  - Does not reverse the quintile numbering; thus, quintile 1 has the highest grades.
- **Result:**
  - Quintile ranks are in reverse order (highest grades have the lowest quintile rank).
  - Does not meet the requirement of having quintile 5 as the highest grade quintile.

### **Reasoning for Choosing Option 1**

- **Even Distribution:**
  - Option 1 uses `NTILE(5)` to distribute students evenly into quintiles based on their grades.
  - This approach adheres to the definition of quintiles, dividing the dataset into five equal or nearly equal parts.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:**
  - The quintile assignment adjusts automatically if the number of students changes.
  - This makes the query robust and scalable.
- **Correct Quintile Ordering:**
  - Reverses the quintile numbering so that quintile 5 corresponds to the highest grades, as required.
- **Simpler and Cleaner SQL:**
  - Utilizes built-in SQL functions effectively.
  - Avoids hardcoding rank ranges, reducing the possibility of errors.

### **Conclusion**

**Option 1** (`1result.sql`) is the correct SQL query because it accurately assigns quintile ranks to students based on their grades, ensuring an even distribution and correct ordering from highest to lowest quintile.
