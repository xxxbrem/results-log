After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **2result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Matching:** The query in **2result.sql** efficiently checks for the specified drug names ('Keytruda', 'Vioxx', 'Premarin', 'Humira') in the `name`, `synonyms`, and `tradeNames` fields using the `EXISTS` clause with `UNNEST`. This method avoids unintended cross joins and ensures accurate matching without duplicating rows.

- **Avoids Cross Joins:** By using `EXISTS` instead of `LEFT JOIN UNNEST`, the query prevents the creation of Cartesian products that could occur due to joining on array fields. This leads to better performance and correct results.

- **Proper Filtering:**
  - Filters for **approved drugs** (`isApproved` = TRUE).
  - Includes only drugs with a **black box warning** (`blackBoxWarning` = TRUE).
  - Excludes drugs with an **unknown drug type** (`drugType` IS NOT NULL AND `drugType` != 'Unknown').

- **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** The use of `LOWER(...)` ensures that the matching of drug names is case-insensitive, capturing all variations of the names in the data.

- **Satisfies Task Requirements:** The query accurately retrieves the drug ID, drug type, and withdrawal status for the specified drugs while adhering to all the conditions mentioned in the task.
