Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `model`
  - `name`: Identifier for the problem or dataset.
    - *Potential usage:* To distinguish between different problems or datasets if needed.
  - `version`: Version number of the model.
    - *Potential usage:* To consider different versions in the analysis.
  - `step`: INTEGER CHECK (step IN (1, 2, 3))
    - *Potential usage:* Indicates the modeling step. Could be used to differentiate between traditional models and the Stack model.
    - *Conditions:*
      - `step IN (1, 2)`: Represents traditional models.
      - `step = 3`: Represents the Stack model.
  - `L1_model`: TEXT CHECK (L1_model IN ("regression", "tree"))
    - *Potential usage:* Specifies the model category. This is the primary column for determining which model category appears most frequently.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **Get all distinct model categories (`L1_model`):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT L1_model FROM model LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get all distinct modeling steps (`step`):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT step FROM model LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the number of models for each modeling step:**
   ```sql
   SELECT step, COUNT(*) AS count_per_step FROM model GROUP BY step LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the number of occurrences for each model category across all steps:**
   ```sql
   SELECT L1_model, COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM model GROUP BY L1_model LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count the number of occurrences for each model category in traditional models (steps 1 and 2):**
   ```sql
   SELECT L1_model, COUNT(*) AS count_in_traditional FROM model WHERE step IN (1, 2) GROUP BY L1_model LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count the number of occurrences for each model category in the Stack model (step 3):**
   ```sql
   SELECT L1_model, COUNT(*) AS count_in_stack FROM model WHERE step = 3 GROUP BY L1_model LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Compare counts of model categories between traditional models and the Stack model:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 'Traditional' AS model_type, L1_model, COUNT(*) AS total_count
   FROM model
   WHERE step IN (1, 2)
   GROUP BY L1_model
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'Stack' AS model_type, L1_model, COUNT(*) AS total_count
   FROM model
   WHERE step = 3
   GROUP BY L1_model
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find the most frequent model category in traditional models:**
   ```sql
   SELECT L1_model, COUNT(*) AS count_in_traditional
   FROM model
   WHERE step IN (1, 2)
   GROUP BY L1_model
   ORDER BY count_in_traditional DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

9. **Find the most frequent model category in the Stack model:**
   ```sql
   SELECT L1_model, COUNT(*) AS count_in_stack
   FROM model
   WHERE step = 3
   GROUP BY L1_model
   ORDER BY count_in_stack DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

10. **List all models with their steps and categories to inspect the data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT name, version, step, L1_model
    FROM model
    ORDER BY name, version, step
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Count the number of models per `step` and `L1_model`:**
    ```sql
    SELECT step, L1_model, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM model
    GROUP BY step, L1_model
    ORDER BY step, L1_model
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find total occurrences of each model category across all steps and versions:**
    ```sql
    SELECT L1_model, COUNT(*) AS total_count
    FROM model
    GROUP BY L1_model
    ORDER BY total_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Identify model categories for each version:**
    ```sql
    SELECT version, L1_model, COUNT(*) AS count_per_version
    FROM model
    GROUP BY version, L1_model
    ORDER BY version, count_per_version DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Compare the proportion of `regression` models between traditional and Stack models:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      'Traditional' AS model_type,
      (SUM(CASE WHEN L1_model = 'regression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*)) AS regression_proportion
    FROM model
    WHERE step IN (1, 2)
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
      'Stack' AS model_type,
      (SUM(CASE WHEN L1_model = 'regression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*)) AS regression_proportion
    FROM model
    WHERE step = 3
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find the model category with the maximum total count across all data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT L1_model, COUNT(*) AS total_count
    FROM model
    GROUP BY L1_model
    ORDER BY total_count DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

16. **Inspect models where `L1_model` is `regression` in traditional models:**
    ```sql
    SELECT name, version, step, L1_model
    FROM model
    WHERE step IN (1, 2) AND L1_model = 'regression'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **Inspect models where `L1_model` is `tree` in the Stack model:**
    ```sql
    SELECT name, version, step, L1_model
    FROM model
    WHERE step = 3 AND L1_model = 'tree'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **Count models per `name` to see if certain datasets have more models:**
    ```sql
    SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS model_count
    FROM model
    GROUP BY name
    ORDER BY model_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **Find the total number of versions per `L1_model`:**
    ```sql
    SELECT L1_model, COUNT(DISTINCT version) AS version_count
    FROM model
    GROUP BY L1_model
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Determine if any `L1_model` is exclusively used in either traditional or Stack models:**
    ```sql
    SELECT L1_model,
      SUM(CASE WHEN step IN (1, 2) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS traditional_count,
      SUM(CASE WHEN step = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS stack_count
    FROM model
    GROUP BY L1_model
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help explore the data to determine which `L1_model` category appears most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and to calculate the total count of its occurrences.Query:

Task: Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
L1_model,Total_count
model_category:str,count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The model category (`L1_model`) that appears the most frequently across all steps and versions is represented as `model_category:str`, with a total count of `count:int` occurrences..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 09:46:06 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
L1_model,Total_count
model_category:str,count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The model category (`L1_model`) that appears the most frequently across all steps and versions is represented as `model_category:str`, with a total count of `count:int` occurrences. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
