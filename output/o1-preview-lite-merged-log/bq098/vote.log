After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct query. Here's why:

1. **Excludes 'EWR' Borough**: The query explicitly excludes trips with the borough 'EWR' (Newark Airport) by using `AND z.borough != 'EWR'` in the WHERE clause. Since 'EWR' is not one of the five boroughs of NYC, excluding it aligns with the task of calculating the percentage of no tips in each NYC borough.

2. **Accurate Borough Representation**: The query considers all five NYC boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island, ensuring the percentages are calculated correctly for each.

3. **Appropriate Ordering**: The results are ordered alphabetically by borough, making it easy to read and verify.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

0result.sql
