The correct SQL query that best answers the task is:

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

The task requires us to find DICOM image files with modalities 'SEG' or 'RTSTRUCT' and a specific SOP Class UID `'1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.66.4'`, grouped by collection, study, and series IDs. Additionally, these images should have **no references** to other series, images, or sources. We are also asked to provide a viewer URL formatted as `'https://viewer.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/viewer/'` followed by the study ID and list the sizes in kilobytes, sorted from largest to smallest.

**Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`:**

   - Filters records where:
     - `"Modality"` is `'SEG'` or `'RTSTRUCT'`.
     - `"SOPClassUID"` matches the specified UID.
     - `"ReferencedSeriesSequence"`, `"ReferencedImageSequence"`, and `"SourceImageSequence"` are either `NULL` or equal to `'[]'`.
   - Potential Issue:
     - Checking if sequences are equal to `'[]'` may not correctly identify empty arrays, especially if the data type is an array rather than a string.

2. **`1result.sql`:**

   - Filters records where:
     - `"Modality"` is `'SEG'` or `'RTSTRUCT'`.
     - `"SOPClassUID"` matches the specified UID.
     - Uses `ARRAY_SIZE()` to ensure sequences are empty arrays, which is more accurate for array data types.
     - Additionally checks that `"ReferencedSOPInstanceUID"` and `"ReferencedSOPClassUID"` are `NULL`, ensuring no other forms of references exist.
   - This query provides a more precise filtering of images with **no references**.

3. **`2result.sql`:**

   - Similar to `0result.sql`, but uses `CONCAT` for the viewer URL.
   - Still checks sequences against `'[]'`, which may not be reliable for arrays.

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate query because:
  - It accurately checks for empty sequences using `ARRAY_SIZE() = 0`, ensuring that arrays are indeed empty.
  - It includes additional checks for `"ReferencedSOPInstanceUID"` and `"ReferencedSOPClassUID"` being `NULL`, covering more possibilities of references.
  - It aligns precisely with the task's requirement to exclude images that have any references to other series, images, or sources.
