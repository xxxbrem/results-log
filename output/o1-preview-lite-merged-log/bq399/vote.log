Upon comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I choose `1result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Explicit Region Filter:** `1result.sql` includes the filter `AND cs.region IS NOT NULL` in the `WHERE` clause. This ensures that only countries with a valid (non-null) region are considered in the analysis. Since the task is to find the highest average crude birth rate in each region, it's important to exclude records where the region information is missing.

- **Ordered Results:** The query `1result.sql` includes `ORDER BY sub.region` at the end, which orders the output by region. This makes the results more organized and easier to interpret.

- **Precision and Accuracy:** By explicitly filtering out countries without a specified region, `1result.sql` provides a more accurate reflection of the highest average crude birth rates within each defined region. Although both queries yield the same results in this particular case, `1result.sql` demonstrates better practice by ensuring data completeness for the regions considered.

Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct SQL query to use for this task.
