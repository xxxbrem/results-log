1. **Table:** `payment`
   - **customer_id**: Used to link payments to customers.
   - **amount**: The payment amount, used to calculate total payments and differences.
   - **payment_date**: The date of each payment, used to extract month and year for grouping.

2. **Table:** `customer`
   - **customer_id**: Primary key, used to identify customers.
   - **first_name**: Customer's first name, used to get full names.
   - **last_name**: Customer's last name, used to get full names.

**Potential Conditions:**

- **Grouping by customer_id** to calculate total payments per customer.
- **Ordering by total payments** to identify the top 10 paying customers.
- **Extracting month and year** from `payment_date` to group payments by month.
- **Calculating differences** in payment amounts between months for each customer.
- **Finding the maximum difference** for each customer among all months.
- **Selecting the customer** among the top 10 who has the highest monthly payment difference.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct customer IDs from the payment table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "customer_id" FROM "payment" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve customer IDs and their total payment amounts:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payment" FROM "payment" GROUP BY "customer_id" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve customer IDs and total payments, ordered by total payment descending:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payment" FROM "payment" GROUP BY "customer_id" ORDER BY "total_payment" DESC LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve the top 10 customers by total payment amount:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payment"
   FROM "payment"
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ORDER BY "total_payment" DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

5. **Retrieve payments per customer per month:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", strftime('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_payment"
   FROM "payment"
   GROUP BY "customer_id", "month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve monthly payments for a specific customer (e.g., customer_id = 1):**
   ```sql
   SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_payment"
   FROM "payment"
   WHERE "customer_id" = 1
   GROUP BY "month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate monthly payment differences for a specific customer:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     "month", 
     "monthly_payment", 
     "monthly_payment" - LAG("monthly_payment") OVER (ORDER BY "month") AS "payment_difference"
   FROM (
     SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_payment"
     FROM "payment"
     WHERE "customer_id" = 1
     GROUP BY "month"
     ORDER BY "month"
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Retrieve monthly payments for the top 10 customers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     "customer_id", 
     strftime('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "month", 
     SUM("amount") AS "monthly_payment"
   FROM "payment"
   WHERE "customer_id" IN (
     SELECT "customer_id"
     FROM "payment"
     GROUP BY "customer_id"
     ORDER BY SUM("amount") DESC
     LIMIT 10
   )
   GROUP BY "customer_id", "month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate the maximum monthly payment difference for each customer:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     "customer_id", 
     MAX("payment_difference") AS "max_monthly_difference"
   FROM (
     SELECT 
       "customer_id", 
       "month", 
       "monthly_payment", 
       "monthly_payment" - LAG("monthly_payment") OVER (PARTITION BY "customer_id" ORDER BY "month") AS "payment_difference"
     FROM (
       SELECT "customer_id", strftime('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_payment"
       FROM "payment"
       GROUP BY "customer_id", "month"
     )
   )
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify the top 10 paying customers and determine which one had the highest payment difference in any given month:**
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      c."customer_id",
      c."first_name",
      c."last_name",
      MAX(p_diff."payment_difference") AS "highest_payment_difference"
    FROM "customer" c
    JOIN (
      SELECT 
        "customer_id", 
        "month", 
        "monthly_payment", 
        "monthly_payment" - LAG("monthly_payment") OVER (PARTITION BY "customer_id" ORDER BY "month") AS "payment_difference"
      FROM (
        SELECT "customer_id", strftime('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_payment"
        FROM "payment"
        WHERE "customer_id" IN (
          SELECT "customer_id"
          FROM "payment"
          GROUP BY "customer_id"
          ORDER BY SUM("amount") DESC
          LIMIT 10
        )
        GROUP BY "customer_id", "month"
      )
    ) p_diff ON c."customer_id" = p_diff."customer_id"
    GROUP BY c."customer_id", c."first_name", c."last_name"
    ORDER BY "highest_payment_difference" DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

This final query identifies among the top 10 paying customers which one had the highest payment difference between any two consecutive months and returns that customer along with the highest payment difference, rounded to two decimal places.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT "customer_id" FROM "payment" LIMIT 100;
Answer:

Task: Can you determine which of our top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month? I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
customer_id,customer_name,highest_payment_difference
customer_id:int,customer_name:str,highest_payment_difference:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

Among the top 10 paying customers, we identified the customer who had the highest difference in payments between any two months. This customer is represented by `customer_id` and `customer_name`. The `highest_payment_difference` is the maximum difference in total payments made by this customer between any two months, rounded to two decimal places..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
customer_id,customer_name,highest_payment_difference
customer_id:int,customer_name:str,highest_payment_difference:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

Among the top 10 paying customers, we identified the customer who had the highest difference in payments between any two months. This customer is represented by `customer_id` and `customer_name`. The `highest_payment_difference` is the maximum difference in total payments made by this customer between any two months, rounded to two decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
