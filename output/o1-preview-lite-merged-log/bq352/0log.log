Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality`

   - **`Year`**: Used to filter records for the year 2018.
   - **`County_of_Residence`**: Identifies the county names.
   - **`County_of_Residence_FIPS`**: Provides FIPS codes for counties to assist in joining datasets.
   - **`Ave_Number_of_Prenatal_Wks`**: The average number of prenatal weeks, which is the target metric.

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2017_1yr`

   - **`geo_id`**: Contains geographic identifiers, including state and county FIPS codes.
   - **`commute_45_59_mins`**: Number of employed people with commute times of 45-59 minutes.
   - **`employed_pop`**: Total number of employed people.
   - **`pop_in_labor_force`**: Total population in the labor force; may be used for additional analysis.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter natality data where `Year` is 2018.
- Extract state FIPS code from `geo_id` and filter for Wisconsin (state FIPS code is `'55'`).
- Calculate the percentage of employed population commuting 45-59 minutes.
- Select counties where this percentage is greater than 5%.

Task: Please list the average number of prenatal weeks in 2018 for counties in Wisconsin where more than 5% of the employed population had commutes of 45-59 minutes in 2017.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
County_Name,Ave_Number_of_Prenatal_Wks
county_name_1:str,Ave_Number_of_Prenatal_Wks_1:float
county_name_2:str,Ave_Number_of_Prenatal_Wks_2:float
...
```

This table lists the average number of prenatal weeks in 2018 for counties in Wisconsin where more than 5% of the employed population had commutes of 45-59 minutes in 2017..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
