After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
```

**Reason:**

- **Use of Common Table Expression (CTE):** The query in `2result.sql` utilizes a CTE (`WITH BestSellingArtist AS (...)`) to define the best-selling artist. This approach enhances readability and makes the query more maintainable, especially for complex queries.

- **Clarity and Separation of Logic:** By separating the subquery that determines the best-selling artist, the main query becomes clearer. It explicitly shows the selection of customers who spent less than $1 on albums by the best-selling artist.

- **Correctness:** The logic in `2result.sql` accurately computes the total sales per artist, identifies the best-selling artist, and then calculates the amount each customer spent on that artist's albums. It correctly filters customers who spent less than $1.

- **Consistency in Results:** The query produces the expected results, matching the data provided, and aligns with the task's requirements.
