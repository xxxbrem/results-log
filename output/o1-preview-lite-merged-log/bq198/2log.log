   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT season
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   ORDER BY season

   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve the number of wins for all teams in 1950:**
   ```sql
   SELECT market, name, wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE season = 1950
   ORDER BY wins DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find the maximum number of wins in each season (1900-2000):**
   ```sql
   SELECT season, MAX(wins) AS max_wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   GROUP BY season
   ORDER BY season
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List teams that had the maximum wins in each season:**
   ```sql
   SELECT hs.season, hs.market, hs.name, hs.wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` hs
   INNER JOIN (
     SELECT season, MAX(wins) AS max_wins
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
     WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     GROUP BY season
   ) mw ON hs.season = mw.season AND hs.wins = mw.max_wins
   ORDER BY hs.season
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count how many times each team had the maximum wins in a season:**
   ```sql
   SELECT hs.market, hs.name, COUNT(*) AS times_max_wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` hs
   INNER JOIN (

   ) mw ON hs.season = mw.season AND hs.wins = mw.max_wins
   GROUP BY hs.market, hs.name
   ORDER BY times_max_wins DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the top 5 teams with the most seasons of maximum wins (1900-2000):**
   ```sql
   SELECT hs.market, hs.name, COUNT(*) AS times_max_wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` hs

   ```sql
   SELECT season, COUNT(*) AS teams_with_max_wins
   FROM (
     SELECT hs.season, hs.market, hs.name
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` hs

   )
   GROUP BY season
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
   ORDER BY season
   LIMIT 100;

10. **Calculate the average wins per season for each team between 1900 and 2000:**
    ```sql
    SELECT market, name, AVG(wins) AS avg_wins
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
    WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY market, name
    ORDER BY avg_wins DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

**Final Answer:**

```csv
Team_Market,Team_Name,Times_Max_Wins
market1:str,name1:str,times1:int
market2:str,name2:str,times2:int
market3:str,name3:str,times3:int
market4:str,name4:str,times4:int
market5:str,name5:str,times5:int
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above represents the top 5 most successful college basketball teams over the seasons from 1900 to 2000, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season. Each row contains:

- **Team_Market**: The school name of the team.
- **Team_Name**: The team's nickname or mascot name.
- **Times_Max_Wins**: The number of seasons between 1900 and 2000 in which the team had the maximum number of wins.

The actual team names and counts would be determined by executing the provided SQL queries against the dataset. Since we are not to infer or fill in specific values without executing the queries, placeholders are used as per the instructions.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT season
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000

Task: What are the top 5 most successful college basketball teams over the seasons from 1900 to 2000, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Team_Market,Team_Name
University of Kentucky,Wildcats
University of Kansas,Jayhawks
University of North Carolina,Tar Heels
UCLA,Bruins
Indiana University,Hoosiers
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the top 5 most successful college basketball teams during the seasons from 1900 to 2000. These teams are historically renowned for their achievements and are often recognized for having numerous seasons with the maximum wins. However, specific counts of the number of times each team had the maximum wins in a season during this period are not available..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 01:35:43 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top 5 most successful college basketball teams over the seasons from 1900 to 2000, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
