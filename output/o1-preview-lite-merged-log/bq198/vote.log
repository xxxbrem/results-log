After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Efficient Computation:** The SQL query in `1result.sql` precomputes the maximum wins for each season using a subquery and then joins this result with the main table. This approach is more efficient than computing the maximum wins within the WHERE clause for each row, as seen in `0result.sql`.

- **Accurate Results:** By joining on both the season and the maximum wins, `1result.sql` accurately identifies all teams that had the maximum number of wins in each season. This ensures that teams sharing the maximum wins in a season are all counted.

- **Consistent Ordering:** The `ORDER BY` clause in `1result.sql` includes `s.market` after ordering by `num_max_wins DESC`. This provides a consistent and deterministic ordering when teams have the same number of maximum wins, which is important for reproducible results.

- **Handling of Null Values:** The query properly accounts for any null or empty `market` values in the data, ensuring that teams are correctly identified and counted.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
