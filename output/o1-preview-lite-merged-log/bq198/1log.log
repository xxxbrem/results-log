- **`team_code`**: School code from NCAA; another identifier that might be useful.

**Conditions to Consider:**

- Filter seasons between **1900 and 2000**: `WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000`
- Identify teams with the **maximum wins** in each season.
- Count the number of times each team achieved the maximum wins.

---

Below are **10 BigQuery SQL queries** to explore and understand the data related to the task.

---

1. **List teams with their wins for seasons between 1900 and 2000**

   ```sql
   SELECT `season`, `market`, `wins`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   ORDER BY `season`, `market`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find all distinct seasons between 1900 and 2000**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `season`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   ORDER BY `season`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get the maximum number of wins in each season**

   ```sql
   SELECT `season`, MAX(`wins`) AS `max_wins`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   GROUP BY `season`
   ORDER BY `season`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List teams that had the maximum wins in their respective seasons**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.`season`, s.`market`, s.`wins`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` AS s
   JOIN (
     SELECT `season`, MAX(`wins`) AS `max_wins`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
     WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     GROUP BY `season`
   ) AS m
   ON s.`season` = m.`season` AND s.`wins` = m.`max_wins`
   WHERE s.`season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   ORDER BY s.`season`, s.`market`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count the number of seasons each team had the maximum wins**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.`market`, COUNT(*) AS `num_max_wins`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` AS s
   JOIN (
     SELECT `season`, MAX(`wins`) AS `max_wins`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
     WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     GROUP BY `season`
   ) AS m
   ON s.`season` = m.`season` AND s.`wins` = m.`max_wins`
   WHERE s.`season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   GROUP BY s.`market`
   ORDER BY `num_max_wins` DESC, s.`market`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List all distinct teams that played between 1900 and 2000**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `market`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   ORDER BY `market`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the highest number of wins each team achieved between 1900 and 2000**

   ```sql
   SELECT `market`, MAX(`wins`) AS `highest_wins`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   GROUP BY `market`
   ORDER BY `highest_wins` DESC, `market`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate the total number of wins each team had between 1900 and 2000**

   ```sql
   SELECT `market`, SUM(`wins`) AS `total_wins`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   GROUP BY `market`
   ORDER BY `total_wins` DESC, `market`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Compute the average number of wins per season for each team**

   ```sql
   SELECT `market`, AVG(`wins`) AS `average_wins`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   GROUP BY `market`
   ORDER BY `average_wins` DESC, `market`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Determine the number of seasons each team played between 1900 and 2000**

    ```sql
    SELECT `market`, COUNT(DISTINCT `season`) AS `num_seasons`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
    WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY `market`
    ORDER BY `num_seasons` DESC, `market`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

By running these queries, we can gather insights into the data, such as:

- How many times each team achieved the maximum wins in a season.
- Which teams had the highest single-season win totals.
- The consistency of teams over the years based on their average wins.
- The total number of wins and the number of seasons played by each team.

These insights will help in identifying the **top 5 most successful college basketball teams** over the specified period based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season.

*Note: To get the final answer to the task, you would run query number 5 and select the top 5 teams based on the `num_max_wins` count.*

---

**Answer Format:**

```csv
market,num_max_wins
Team A,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team B,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team C,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team D,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team E,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **`market`**: The school name of the college basketball team.
- **`num_max_wins`**: The number of seasons between 1900 and 2000 in which the team had the maximum number of wins.

*Note:* Specific team names and counts are not provided here. Running the provided queries on the actual dataset will yield the exact results.Query:

Task: What are the top 5 most successful college basketball teams over the seasons from 1900 to 2000, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the **top 5 most successful college basketball teams** over the seasons from **1900 to 2000**, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season, we would perform the following steps using the `mbb_historical_teams_seasons` table from the `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball` dataset:

1. **Filter** the data for seasons between 1900 and 2000.
2. **Identify** the maximum number of wins for each season.
3. **Find** the teams that achieved this maximum number of wins in each season.
4. **Count** the number of times each team had the maximum wins over all seasons in the range.
5. **Sort** the teams in descending order of these counts.
6. **Select** the top 5 teams.

The results would be presented in the following format:

```csv
market,num_max_wins
Team A,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team B,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team C,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team D,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team E,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

- **market**: The school name of the college basketball team.
- **num_max_wins**: The number of seasons between 1900 and 2000 in which the team had the maximum number of wins.

*Note:* Without access to execute the SQL query on the actual dataset, specific team names and counts cannot be provided here. However, following the above steps on the dataset will yield the desired top 5 teams..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 20:32:47 - root - INFO - To determine the **top 5 most successful college basketball teams** over the seasons from **1900 to 2000**, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season, we would perform the following steps using the `mbb_historical_teams_seasons` table from the `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball` dataset:

4. **Count** the number of times each team had the maximum wins over all seasons in the range.
5. **Sort** the teams in descending order of these counts.
6. **Select** the top 5 teams.

The SQL query to achieve this is:

```sql
SELECT s.market, COUNT(*) AS num_max_wins
FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` AS s
JOIN (
  SELECT season, MAX(wins) AS max_wins
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`

ON s.season = m.season AND s.wins = m.max_wins
WHERE s.season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
GROUP BY s.market
ORDER BY num_max_wins DESC, s.market
LIMIT 5;
```

**Explanation:**

- The subquery `m` computes the maximum number of wins (`max_wins`) for each season between 1900 and 2000.
- We join this subquery with the original table `s` on matching `season` and where the team's `wins` equal `max_wins`.
- This effectively filters the teams that had the highest number of wins in each season.
- We then group the results by `s.market` (team's school name) and count the number of times (`COUNT(*)`) each team appears, which indicates the number of seasons they had the maximum wins.
- Finally, we order the results by `num_max_wins` in descending order to find the most successful teams, and limit the output to the top 5 teams.

**Result Format:**

```csv
market,num_max_wins
Team A,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team B,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team C,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team D,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team E,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
```

**Note:** The actual team names and counts will be populated when the query is executed on the dataset. The results will show the top 5 teams based on the number of seasons they had the maximum wins between 1900 and 2000.
